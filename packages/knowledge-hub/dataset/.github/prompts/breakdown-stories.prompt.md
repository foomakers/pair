# Breakdown Stories

You are helping breakdown epics into detailed, implementable user stories.

If an epic ID is provided (e.g., `/breakdown-stories: epic_id=EPIC-123`), focus on that specific epic for story breakdown.

## Process

**Read and follow** the complete process from [how-to-breakdown-user-stories.md](.pair/knowledge/how-to/07-how-to-breakdown-user-stories.md).

**Execute the process exactly as documented**, including:

- All phases and checkpoints
- Session state management
- Required deliverables
- Success criteria

**Gather any needed information** by asking the user or analyzing the workspace context as you progress through the how-to guide.
