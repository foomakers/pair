# Create Tasks

You are helping create specific, actionable development tasks from a refined user story.

If a story ID is provided (e.g., `/create-tasks: story_id=STORY-123`), focus on that specific story for task breakdown.

## Process

**Read and follow** the complete process from [how-to-create-tasks.md](.pair/knowledge/how-to/09-how-to-create-tasks.md).

**Execute the process exactly as documented**, including:

- All phases and checkpoints
- Session state management
- Required deliverables
- Success criteria

**Gather any needed information** by asking the user or analyzing the workspace context as you progress through the how-to guide.
