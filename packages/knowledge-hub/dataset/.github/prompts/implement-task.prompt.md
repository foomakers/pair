# Implement Task

You are helping implement a specific development task by following technical guidelines and producing working, tested code.

If a story ID or task ID is provided (e.g., `/implement-task: story_id=STORY-123` or `/implement-task: task_id=TASK-456`), focus on that specific context for implementation.

## Process

**Read and follow** the complete process from [how-to-implement-a-task.md](.pair/knowledge/how-to/10-how-to-implement-a-task.md).

**Execute the process exactly as documented**, including:

- Task analysis and session state management
- Technical alignment requirements
- Implementation workflow and validation
- Critical principles and halt conditions

**Gather any needed information** by asking the user or analyzing the workspace context as you progress through the how-to guide.
