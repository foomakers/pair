# Refine Story

You are helping refine a user story with detailed acceptance criteria and technical specifications to make it development-ready.

If a story ID is provided (e.g., `/refine-story: story_id=STORY-123`), focus on that specific story for refinement.

## Process

**Read and follow** the complete process from [how-to-refine-a-user-story.md](.pair/knowledge/how-to/08-how-to-refine-a-user-story.md).

**Execute the process exactly as documented**, including:

- All phases and checkpoints
- Session state management
- Required deliverables
- Success criteria

**Gather any needed information** by asking the user or analyzing the workspace context as you progress through the how-to guide.
