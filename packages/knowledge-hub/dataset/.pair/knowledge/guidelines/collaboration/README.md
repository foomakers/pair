## Navigation Guide

### By Use Case

**Setting up a new project:**

1. Start with [methodology/](methodology/README.md) to choose methodology
2. Use [project-management-tool/](project-management-tool/README.md) to select and setup tool
3. Configure workflows using topic-specific guides

**Daily operations:**

- [issue-management/](issue-management/README.md) for issue workflows
- [project-tracking/](project-tracking/README.md) for progress monitoring
- [board-management.md](board-management.md) for board setup and optimization

**Team coordination:**

- [communication-protocols.md](communication-protocols.md) for communication standards
- [role-responsibilities.md](role-responsibilities.md) for role clarity
- [decision-making.md](decision-making.md) for decision processes

### By Tool

**GitHub users:** Start with [project-management-tool/github-implementation.md](project-management-tool/github-implementation.md) for complete tool-specific navigation

**Filesystem users:** Start with [project-management-tool/filesystem-implementation.md](project-management-tool/filesystem-implementation.md) for complete tool-specific navigation
