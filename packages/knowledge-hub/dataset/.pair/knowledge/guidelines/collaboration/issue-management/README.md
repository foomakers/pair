# Issue Management

Issue tracking workflows and management practices across different project management tools.

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive guidance for managing issues, bugs, feature requests, and tasks throughout the development lifecycle. Content covers both tool-agnostic principles and tool-specific implementations.

## Tool-Specific Implementations

### GitHub Issues

- **[github-issues.md](github-issues.md)** - GitHub Issues workflow and configuration
  - Issue templates and labeling strategies
  - GitHub-specific automation and integration
  - Project board integration and workflow rules
  - Pull request linking and status synchronization

### Filesystem Issues

- **[filesystem-issues.md](filesystem-issues.md)** - Local file-based issue tracking
  - Markdown-based issue tracking patterns
  - Directory structure for issue organization
  - Local automation scripts and workflows
  - Integration with development tools

## Core Concepts

### Issue Lifecycle

1. **Creation** - Issue identification and initial documentation
2. **Triage** - Priority assessment and assignment
3. **Refinement** - Detailed analysis and breakdown
4. **Implementation** - Development work execution
5. **Review** - Quality assurance and validation
6. **Closure** - Resolution and documentation

### Issue Types

- **Bug Reports** - Defect identification and resolution
- **Feature Requests** - New functionality requirements
- **User Stories** - User-centered functionality descriptions
- **Tasks** - Development and maintenance activities
- **Epic Breakdown** - Large feature decomposition

### Priority Management

- **P0 (Critical)** - Production issues, blockers
- **P1 (High)** - Important features, significant bugs
- **P2 (Medium)** - Standard features, minor bugs
- **P3 (Low)** - Nice-to-have features, cosmetic issues

## Best Practices

### Issue Documentation

- Clear, actionable titles
- Detailed descriptions with context
- Acceptance criteria for features
- Reproduction steps for bugs
- Links to related issues and documentation

### Workflow Integration

- Consistent labeling and categorization
- Automated status updates based on development progress
- Integration with project tracking and boards
- Regular review and cleanup processes

## Integration Points

### With Project Tracking

**→ See [../project-tracking/](../project-tracking/README.md)**

- Issue hierarchy and relationships
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Sprint and milestone planning

### With Automation

**→ See [../automation/](../automation/README.md)**

- Automated issue creation and updates
- Status synchronization rules
- Integration with development workflows

### With Estimation

**→ See [../estimation/](../estimation/README.md)**

- Issue sizing and effort estimation
- Complexity assessment workflows
- Planning and forecasting integration
