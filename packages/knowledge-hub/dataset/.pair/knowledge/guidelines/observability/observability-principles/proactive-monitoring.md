# Proactive Monitoring

## Purpose

Define proactive monitoring strategies that enable early problem detection and prevention rather than reactive incident response.

## Scope

#### In Scope:

- Early warning system design
- Predictive monitoring approaches
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Preventive maintenance strategies
- Capacity planning methodologies
- Risk assessment frameworks

#### Out of Scope:

- Reactive incident response procedures
- Post-incident analysis processes
- Specific tool configurations
- Infrastructure hardware monitoring

## Proactive vs. Reactive Monitoring

### Reactive Monitoring

**Characteristics:**

- Problem detection after occurrence
- Threshold-based alerting
- Incident response focus
- User-impact visibility

#### Limitations:

- User impact before detection
- Limited prevention capability
- High resolution costs
- Reactive team culture

### Proactive Monitoring

**Characteristics:**

- Problem prediction before occurrence
- Trend-based analysis
- Prevention focus
- Leading indicator tracking

#### Benefits:

- Prevention over cure
- Reduced user impact
- Lower resolution costs
- Proactive team culture
