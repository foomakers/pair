# 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

System architecture patterns, bounded contexts, and architectural decision processes for scalable software design.

## 📚 Architecture Practices

### Core Architecture

- **[Architectural Guidelines](architectural-guidelines.md)** - System architecture patterns, bounded contexts, and ADR processes
  - Domain-driven design principles
  - Bounded context definitions
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADR) process
  - System integration patterns
  - Scalability and maintainability guidelines

## 🔗 Related Guidelines

- **[Operations Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/operations)** - Infrastructure deployment strategies for these patterns
- **[Quality Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality)** - Quality criteria ensuring architectural integrity

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Start Here**: Read [Architectural Guidelines](architectural-guidelines.md) for system design principles
2. **Define Contexts**: Use bounded context patterns for domain modeling
3. **Document Decisions**: Follow ADR process for architectural choices
4. **Validate Design**: Ensure alignment with [Definition of Done](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/definition-of-done.md)

---
*Assistant Context: Focus on system architecture, bounded contexts, and ADR processes when discussing architectural decisions.*
