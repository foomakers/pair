# ✨ Quality Standards (Level 2)

**Focus**: Code quality metrics, linting, and technical debt management

Define standards for maintaining high code quality through automated tooling, metrics, and processes that ensure consistent code standards and technical debt management.

## 📚 Quality Standards (Level 3)

### ESLint Configuration

- **[ESLint Configuration](eslint-configuration.md)** - Linting standards and configuration management
  - Shared ESLint configuration for workspace consistency
  - React-specific extensions and jsx-a11y integration
  - TypeScript-specific rules and type checking
  - Project-specific configuration patterns and overrides
  - Accessibility linting integration for WCAG compliance

### Prettier Configuration

- **[Prettier Configuration](prettier-configuration.md)** - Code formatting standards and automation
  - Shared Prettier configuration across workspace
  - Import organization and sorting standards
  - Code formatting rules and consistency patterns
  - Integration with development workflow and pre-commit hooks
  - Tool-specific formatting configuration and setup

### Quality Metrics

- **[Quality Metrics](quality-metrics.md)** - Code quality measurement and thresholds
  - Coverage requirements and testing standards
  - Complexity analysis and cyclomatic complexity limits
  - Code duplication detection and management
  - Quality gate thresholds and automated enforcement
  - Continuous quality monitoring and reporting

### Automated Gates

- **[Automated Gates](automated-gates.md)** - Automated quality validation and enforcement
  - Pre-commit hooks and validation processes
  - CI/CD quality gate integration and enforcement
  - Build failure conditions and quality thresholds
  - Automated code review and validation processes
  - Quality dashboard and reporting automation

### Technical Debt

- **Technical Debt Management** - Technical debt identification, tracking, and management
  - Technical debt KPIs and measurement strategies
  - Code quality metrics for debt identification
  - Incremental debt reduction and prevention strategies
  - Quality gate enforcement and threshold management
  - Dedicated time allocation for debt reduction activities

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Linting Foundation**: Configure [ESLint Configuration](eslint-configuration.md) for consistent code standards
2. **Formatting Automation**: Set up [Prettier Configuration](prettier-configuration.md) for automated formatting
3. **Quality Measurement**: Establish [Quality Metrics](quality-metrics.md) and monitoring
4. **Automation**: Implement [Automated Gates](automated-gates.md) for continuous validation
5. **Debt Management**: Create technical debt tracking and reduction processes
