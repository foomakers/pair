# 🎨 Code Design Guidelines

**Focus**: How to write high-quality, maintainable code

Define code structure, design patterns, and implementation standards that ensure high code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## 📚 Code Design Practices (Level 2)

### Design Principles Practice

- **[Design Principles](design-principles/README.md)** - Core design principles and code quality fundamentals
  - Clear and readable code principles
  - SOLID principles application
  - Functional programming concepts
  - Domain-driven design principles

### Framework Patterns Practice

- **[Framework Patterns](framework-patterns/README.md)** - Framework-specific implementation patterns and standards
  - React/Next.js component and state management patterns
  - Fastify service architecture and API patterns
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Component design and reusability patterns

### Implementation Standards Practice

- **[Implementation Standards](implementation-standards/README.md)** - Development environment and service implementation standards
  - Local development independence strategies
  - Service abstraction and mocking patterns
  - Environment switching and configuration management
  - Function design and error handling standards

### Organization Patterns Practice

- **[Organization Patterns](organization-patterns/README.md)** - Code and workspace organization strategies
  - File structure and naming conventions
  - Feature-based architecture patterns
  - Monorepo organization and dependency management
  - Workspace structure and module guidelines

### Quality Standards Practice

- **[Quality Standards](quality-standards/README.md)** - Code quality metrics, linting, and technical debt management
  - ESLint and Prettier configuration standards
  - Quality metrics and automated gates
  - Technical debt identification and management
  - Coverage requirements and complexity analysis

## 🔗 Related Guidelines

- **[Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/README.md)** - Technology choices that support code design decisions
- **[Testing](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/README.md)** - Testing strategies that validate code design quality
- **[Quality Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/README.md)** - Quality criteria for code design validation

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Design Foundation**: Start with [Design Principles](design-principles/README.md) for fundamental code quality concepts
2. **Framework Implementation**: Apply [Framework Patterns](framework-patterns/README.md) for your tech stack
3. **Development Setup**: Configure [Implementation Standards](implementation-standards/README.md) for your environment
4. **Code Organization**: Structure your code using [Organization Patterns](organization-patterns/README.md)
5. **Quality Gates**: Implement [Quality Standards](quality-standards/README.md) for continuous validation
