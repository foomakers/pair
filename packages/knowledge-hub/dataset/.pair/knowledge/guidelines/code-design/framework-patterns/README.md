# ⚛️ Framework Patterns (Level 2)

**Focus**: Framework-specific implementation patterns and standards

Framework-specific patterns and implementation standards for React/Next.js and Fastify, ensuring consistent and efficient development practices within chosen technology stacks.

## 📚 Framework Patterns (Level 3)

### React/Next.js Patterns

- **[React/Next.js Patterns](react-nextjs-patterns.md)** - Component patterns, state management, and Next.js specific implementations
  - Function component definitions and props management
  - Custom hooks patterns and reusable logic
  - State management with useReducer and context patterns
  - Next.js specific patterns for pages, API routes, and SSR/SSG
  - Component composition and children patterns

### Fastify Patterns

- **[Fastify Patterns](fastify-patterns.md)** - Service architecture, route handling, and API design patterns
  - Route structure and handler patterns
  - Service layer design and business logic organization
  - Repository pattern for data access abstraction
  - Error handling patterns and result types
  - Dependency injection and service composition

### Component Design

- **[Component Design](component-design.md)** - Reusable component design and composition strategies
  - Component API design and prop interfaces
  - Composition vs inheritance patterns
  - Higher-order components and render props
  - Component testing and documentation standards
  - Design system integration and consistency

### State Management

- **[State Management](state-management.md)** - Application state patterns and data flow management
  - Local state patterns with useState and useReducer
  - Global state management with context and custom solutions
  - Server state management and data fetching patterns
  - State synchronization and consistency strategies
  - Performance optimization for state updates

### Performance Patterns

- **[Performance Patterns](performance-patterns.md)** - Performance optimization patterns and best practices
  - React performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback
  - Code splitting and lazy loading strategies
  - Bundle optimization and tree shaking
  - API performance patterns and caching strategies
  - Memory management and resource cleanup

## 🔗 Related Practices

- **[Design Principles](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/design-principles/README.md)** - Apply core principles within framework patterns
- **[Implementation Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/implementation-standards/README.md)** - Implement these patterns consistently
- **[Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/tech-stack/README.md)** - Technology choices supporting these patterns

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Frontend Foundation**: Master [React/Next.js Patterns](react-nextjs-patterns.md) for frontend development
2. **Backend Foundation**: Apply [Fastify Patterns](fastify-patterns.md) for API development
3. **Component Design**: Implement [Component Design](component-design.md) for reusability
4. **State Management**: Choose appropriate [State Management](state-management.md) patterns
5. **Optimization**: Apply [Performance Patterns](performance-patterns.md) for efficiency
