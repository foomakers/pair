# 🎯 Design Principles (Level 2)

**Focus**: Core design principles and code quality fundamentals

Fundamental design principles that guide high-quality code development, ensuring readability, maintainability, and long-term sustainability.

## 📚 Design Principles (Level 3)

### Clear and Readable Code

- **[Clear and Readable Code](clear-readable-code.md)** - Self-documenting code practices and readability standards
  - Descriptive naming conventions and meaningful identifiers
  - Self-documenting code principles and comment guidelines
  - Code structure for maximum readability and comprehension
  - Function and class design for clarity and purpose

### SOLID Principles

- **[SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md)** - Object-oriented design principles for maintainable code
  - Single Responsibility Principle and focused components
  - Open/Closed Principle for extensible design
  - Liskov Substitution and interface design
  - Interface Segregation and minimal dependencies
  - Dependency Inversion and abstraction layers

### Functional Programming

- **[Functional Programming](functional-programming.md)** - Functional programming concepts and immutable design
  - Pure functions and side-effect management
  - Immutability principles and data handling
  - Function composition and pipeline patterns
  - Functional error handling and result types

### Domain-Driven Design

- **[Domain-Driven Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/architecture/domain-driven-design.md)** - Domain modeling principles and bounded context design
  - Domain modeling and business logic encapsulation
  - Bounded context design and service boundaries
  - Entity and value object patterns
  - Domain event handling and communication

## 🔗 Related Practices

- **[Framework Patterns](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/framework-patterns/README.md)** - Apply these principles within specific frameworks
- **[Quality Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/quality-standards/README.md)** - Validate adherence to these principles
- **[Implementation Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/implementation-standards/README.md)** - Implement these principles in practice

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Foundation**: Start with [Clear and Readable Code](clear-readable-code.md) principles
2. **Structure**: Apply [SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md) for maintainable design
3. **Paradigm**: Integrate [Functional Programming](functional-programming.md) concepts
4. **Domain**: Use [Domain-Driven Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/architecture/domain-driven-design.md) for business logic
