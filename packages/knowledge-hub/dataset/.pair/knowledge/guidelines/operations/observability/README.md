# 📊 Observability Practice (Level 2)

Application monitoring, logging, alerting, and performance observability for comprehensive system visibility and incident management.

## Purpose

Define observability strategies, monitoring patterns, and incident management processes that ensure comprehensive system visibility, proactive issue detection, and effective incident response.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Application monitoring and metrics collection
- Logging strategies and log management
- Alerting and incident management processes
- Performance observability and tracing
- System health monitoring and dashboards

**Out of Scope:**
- Infrastructure monitoring details (see [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/README.md))
- Security monitoring implementation (see [Security](../../quality/security/README.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](../../quality/performance/README.md))
- Development environment monitoring (see [Technical Standards](../../development/technical-standards/README.md))
