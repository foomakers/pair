# 🏗️ Infrastructure Practice (Level 2)

Infrastructure deployment strategies, container orchestration, cloud services, and monitoring for scalable and reliable operations.

## Purpose

Define infrastructure deployment strategies, container orchestration patterns, and cloud service management that ensure scalable, reliable, and maintainable operational infrastructure.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Deployment strategies and infrastructure patterns
- Container orchestration and service management
- Cloud infrastructure and service configuration
- Infrastructure monitoring and observability
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices

**Out of Scope:**

- Application-level observability (see [Observability](./observability/README.md))
- Security implementation details (see [Security](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/security/README.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/performance/README.md))
- Development environment setup (see [Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/README.md))
