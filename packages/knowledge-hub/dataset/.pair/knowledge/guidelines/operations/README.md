# ⚙️ Operations Guidelines (Level 1)

Infrastructure standards, UX design guidelines, and observability practices for reliable software operations.

## 📚 Operations Practices (Level 2)

### Infrastructure Practice

- **[Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)** - Infrastructure standards and deployment guidelines
  - Infrastructure architecture and provisioning
  - Deployment strategies and automation
  - Environment management and configuration
  - Scalability and reliability patterns

### UX Design Practice

- **[UX Design](ux-design/README.md)** - User experience design standards and interface guidelines
  - User experience design principles
  - Interface design patterns and components
  - User research and testing methodologies
  - Design system standards and consistency

### Observability Practice

- **[Observability](observability/README.md)** - Monitoring, logging, and observability standards
  - Monitoring and alerting strategies
  - Logging standards and centralization
  - Performance tracking and metrics
  - Incident response and troubleshooting

## 🛠️ Level 3: Tool-Specific Implementations

_Each practice folder contains tool-specific guides and implementations:_

- Infrastructure tools (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes)
- UX design tools (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD)
- Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)
- Deployment and automation tools

## 🔗 Related Guidelines

- **[Architecture Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/architecture/README.md)** - Architectural patterns supporting operational requirements
- **[Quality Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/README.md)** - Quality standards for operational excellence
- **[Development Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/development/README.md)** - Development practices supporting operations

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Infrastructure**: Configure [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md) for reliable deployment and scaling
2. **UX Standards**: Implement [UX Design](ux-design) guidelines for consistent user experience
3. **Monitoring**: Establish [Observability](observability) for system health and performance tracking
4. **Integration**: Align operational practices with [Quality Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/standards)
