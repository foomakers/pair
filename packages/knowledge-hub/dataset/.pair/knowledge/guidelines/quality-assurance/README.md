# Quality Assurance Framework

## 🎯 **SCOPE & PURPOSE**

This comprehensive quality assurance framework ensures systematic quality management through accessibility standards, performance optimization, security protocols, and continuous verification across all development phases and product deliverables.

**In Scope:**
- Quality standards and practices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA)
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Security testing and compliance
- Automated and manual verification processes
- Quality monitoring and reporting

**Out of Scope:**
- Product functional requirements
- Business logic implementation
- Infrastructure deployment (covered in infrastructure guidelines)
- Development tools configuration (covered in technical standards)
