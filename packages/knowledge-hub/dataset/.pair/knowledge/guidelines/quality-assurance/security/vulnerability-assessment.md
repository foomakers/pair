# Vulnerability Assessment

## 🎯 **PURPOSE**

Systematic identification, classification, and prioritization of security vulnerabilities through comprehensive assessment methodologies that evaluate application security posture and provide actionable remediation guidance.

## 🔍 **ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY**

### **Vulnerability Assessment Framework**

A structured approach combining automated scanning, manual testing, and risk analysis to identify and evaluate security weaknesses across applications, infrastructure, and processes.

#### Assessment Phases:

1. **Discovery**: Asset identification and attack surface mapping
2. **Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection using multiple tools
3. **Validation**: Manual verification of findings and false positive elimination
4. **Risk Analysis**: Business impact assessment and threat modeling
5. **Prioritization**: Risk-based ranking for remediation planning

### **Assessment Types**

#### Network Vulnerability Assessment

- Port scanning and service enumeration
- Network protocol vulnerability testing
- Firewall and network security validation
- Wireless network security assessment

#### Web Application Assessment

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability testing
- Business logic flaw identification
- Client-side security evaluation
- API security assessment

#### Infrastructure Assessment

- Operating system vulnerability scanning
- Database security evaluation
- Configuration baseline validation
- Patch management assessment

## 🛡️ **VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION**

### **CVSS Scoring Framework**

#### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 3.1

#### Base Score Metrics:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low, High
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: None, Low, High
- **User Interaction (UI)**: None, Required
- **Scope (S)**: Unchanged, Changed
- **Impact Metrics**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

#### Example CVSS Scoring:

```text
CVE-2023-1234: SQL Injection in User Search
Base Score: 8.8 (High)
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
```

### **Risk Categorization**

#### Critical (9.0-10.0)

- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation to admin/root
- Complete system compromise potential
- Data breach with sensitive information exposure

#### High (7.0-8.9)

- Authentication bypass mechanisms
- Significant data exposure risks
- Local privilege escalation
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

#### Medium (4.0-6.9)

- Information disclosure issues
- Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- Cross-site request forgery
- Configuration weaknesses

#### Low (0.1-3.9)

- Minor information leakage
- Low-impact denial of service
- Non-security impacting misconfigurations
- Theoretical attack scenarios

## 📊 **ASSESSMENT TOOLS & TECHNIQUES**

### **Automated Scanning Tools**

#### Network Scanners

```bash
# Nmap comprehensive scan
nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -A -p- target.domain.com

# Nuclei vulnerability scanner
nuclei -u https://target.domain.com -t vulnerabilities/ -o nuclei-results.json
```

#### Web Application Scanners

```bash
# Nikto web server scanner
nikto -h https://target.domain.com -Format json -output nikto-results.json

# SQLMap for SQL injection testing
sqlmap -u "https://target.domain.com/search?q=test" --batch --risk=3
```

#### Infrastructure Scanners

```bash
# OpenVAS vulnerability assessment
openvas-start
omp -u admin -w password --xml="<get_tasks/>"

# Nessus API integration
curl -X POST https://nessus-server:8834/scans \
  -H "X-ApiKeys: accessKey=ABC123;secretKey=DEF456" \
  -d '{"uuid":"scan-template-uuid","settings":{"name":"Target Scan","target":"192.168.1.0/24"}}'
```

### **Manual Testing Methodologies**

#### OWASP Testing Guide Approach

- Information gathering and reconnaissance
- Configuration and deployment management testing
- Identity management and authentication testing
- Authorization testing and session management
- Input validation and error handling testing
- Weak cryptography and business logic testing

#### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

- Pre-engagement interactions
- Intelligence gathering
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability analysis
- Exploitation and post-exploitation
- Reporting and remediation validation

## 🎯 **ASSESSMENT EXECUTION**

### **Vulnerability Assessment Workflow**

#### Pre-Assessment Planning

```yaml
assessment_scope:
  targets:
    - web_applications: ['https://app.company.com', 'https://api.company.com']
    - network_ranges: ['10.0.0.0/24', '192.168.1.0/24']
    - infrastructure: ['databases', 'load_balancers', 'firewalls']

  exclusions:
    - production_databases: 'No destructive testing'
    - payment_systems: 'PCI compliance restrictions'

  timeline:
    start_date: '2024-01-15'
    end_date: '2024-01-29'
    reporting_deadline: '2024-02-05'
```

#### Assessment Execution

1. **Asset Discovery**

   - Passive reconnaissance and OSINT gathering
   - Active network scanning and service enumeration
   - Application mapping and technology identification

2. **Vulnerability Identification**

   - Automated scanner deployment across all targets
   - Manual testing for business logic vulnerabilities
   - Configuration review and baseline comparison

3. **Validation and Analysis**
   - False positive elimination through manual verification
   - Exploit proof-of-concept development for critical findings
   - Business impact assessment for each vulnerability

### **Quality Assurance Process**

#### Finding Validation Checklist

- [ ] Vulnerability reproduced manually
- [ ] Business impact clearly defined
- [ ] Remediation guidance provided
- [ ] Risk rating justified with evidence
- [ ] False positive rate below 10%

#### Report Quality Standards

- Executive summary with business risk focus
- Technical details with proof-of-concept
- Clear remediation steps with timelines
- Risk-based prioritization matrix
- Compliance mapping (OWASP, NIST, etc.)

## 📋 **REMEDIATION MANAGEMENT**

### **Vulnerability Lifecycle**

#### Status Tracking

- **New**: Recently identified vulnerability
- **Confirmed**: Validated and verified finding
- **In Progress**: Remediation work initiated
- **Fixed**: Remediation implemented
- **Verified**: Fix validated through retesting
- **Closed**: Vulnerability successfully resolved

### **Remediation Prioritization Matrix**

| Risk Level | Business Impact | Remediation SLA |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Critical   | High            | 1-3 days        |
| High       | Medium-High     | 1-2 weeks       |
| Medium     | Low-Medium      | 1 month         |
| Low        | Minimal         | Next cycle      |

#### Remediation Tracking

  "status": "in_progress",
  "assigned_to": "security-team@company.com",
  "remediation_plan": {
    "short_term": "Apply input validation patches",
    "long_term": "Implement secure coding training",
    "target_date": "2024-02-15"
