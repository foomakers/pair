# Asset Collection

## Introduction

Asset collection encompasses the systematic gathering, organization, and management of design assets that support consistent user experiences across products and platforms. This includes the creation and maintenance of design libraries, brand elements, icons, images, and other visual components that form the foundation of digital products.
