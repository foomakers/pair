# User Research

## Scope

User research provides the systematic foundation for understanding user needs, behaviors, motivations, and contexts that inform design decisions and product strategy. This comprehensive framework encompasses qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, data collection and analysis techniques, and insight synthesis processes that ensure user-centered design approaches and evidence-based decision making throughout the product development lifecycle.

This framework addresses:

- Research methodology selection and execution planning
- Qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques
- User behavior analysis and insight synthesis methods
- Research ethics and participant safety protocols
- Stakeholder communication and research democratization
- Research operations and scaling frameworks
- International and cross-cultural research considerations
- Research integration with design and development processes
- Research impact measurement and value demonstration
- Continuous research programs and longitudinal studies
