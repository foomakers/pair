# Communication Design

## Introduction

Communication design focuses on creating clear, effective, and purposeful communication through visual and textual elements in user interfaces. This discipline bridges the gap between information architecture and visual design, ensuring that users can easily understand and interact with digital products through well-crafted messaging, hierarchies, and communication patterns.

## Communication Design Framework

### Information Hierarchy

**Content Prioritization**

```
Information Priority Levels:
├── Primary (Critical)
│   ├── Core task completion
│   ├── Error prevention
│   └── Safety information
├── Secondary (Important)
│   ├── Task guidance
│   ├── Status updates
│   └── Navigation support
└── Tertiary (Helpful)
    ├── Additional context
    ├── Tips and suggestions
    └── Related information
```

**Visual Hierarchy Techniques**

3. **Solution Guidance**: How to fix it
4. **Prevention Tips**: How to avoid it

**Error Message Examples**

```
Poor: "Error 404"
Better: "Page not found. The link may be broken or the page may have moved."
Best: "Page not found. This link may be outdated. Try searching for what you need or return to the homepage."
```
