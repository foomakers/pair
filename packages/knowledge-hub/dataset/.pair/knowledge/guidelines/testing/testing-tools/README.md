# 🛠️ Testing Tools (Level 2)

**Focus**: Testing frameworks, utilities, and tool configuration

Define the tools, frameworks, and utilities used for testing, ensuring consistent tooling choices and optimal configuration for testing workflows.

## 📚 Testing Tools (Level 3)

### Test Frameworks

- **[Test Frameworks](test-frameworks.md)** - Testing framework selection and configuration
  - Unit testing frameworks (Vitest, Jest) configuration and setup
  - Integration testing framework patterns and configuration
  - E2E testing frameworks (Playwright, Cypress) setup and optimization
  - Framework-specific patterns and best practices
  - Framework integration with development workflow and CI/CD

### Testing Utilities

- **[Testing Utilities](testing-utilities.md)** - Testing utility libraries and helper functions
  - Testing utility libraries and helper function design
  - Test data generation and management utilities
  - Custom testing utilities and reusable test patterns
  - Testing utility organization and sharing strategies
  - Utility library maintenance and version management

### Mock Tools

- **[Mock Tools](mock-tools.md)** - Mocking frameworks and test isolation tools
  - Mocking frameworks and service virtualization tools
  - Test data mocking and realistic data generation
  - External service mocking and integration test isolation
  - Mock lifecycle management and test environment setup
  - Mock validation and behavior verification strategies

### Assertion Libraries

- **[Assertion Libraries](assertion-libraries.md)** - Assertion frameworks and validation utilities
  - Assertion library selection and configuration
  - Custom assertion development and domain-specific validation
  - Assertion readability and test maintainability
  - Error messaging and test failure diagnosis
  - Assertion integration with testing frameworks

### Test Runners

- **[Test Runners](test-runners.md)** - Test execution environments and runner configuration
  - Test runner configuration and optimization
  - Parallel test execution and resource management
  - Test runner integration with development tools
  - Test execution monitoring and reporting integration
  - Test runner performance optimization and scalability

## 🔗 Related Practices

- **[Testing Strategy](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/testing-strategy/README.md)** - Strategic foundation for tool selection
- **[Test Automation](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/test-automation/README.md)** - Automation frameworks using these tools
- **[Development Tools](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/development-tools/README.md)** - Integration with development toolchain

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Framework Selection**: Choose and configure [Test Frameworks](test-frameworks.md) for your testing needs
2. **Utility Setup**: Establish [Testing Utilities](testing-utilities.md) for efficient test development
3. **Isolation Tools**: Configure [Mock Tools](mock-tools.md) for reliable test isolation
4. **Validation Framework**: Set up [Assertion Libraries](assertion-libraries.md) for clear test validation
5. **Execution Optimization**: Configure [Test Runners](test-runners.md) for efficient test execution
