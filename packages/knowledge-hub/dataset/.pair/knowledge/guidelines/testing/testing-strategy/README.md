# 🎯 Testing Strategy (Level 2)

**Focus**: Testing philosophy, pyramid strategy, and comprehensive approaches

Define the strategic approach to testing that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability through comprehensive testing methodologies and quality assurance processes.

## 📚 Testing Strategy (Level 3)

### Testing Philosophy

- **[Testing Philosophy](testing-philosophy.md)** - Core testing principles and enhanced testing approaches
  - Enhanced testing methodology and quality-first mindset
  - Testing as documentation and specification
  - Shift-left testing principles and early validation
  - Risk-based testing and priority-driven validation
  - Continuous testing integration and feedback loops

### Test Pyramid

- **[Test Pyramid](test-pyramid.md)** - Test distribution strategy and pyramid implementation
  - Unit Tests (70%) - Fast, isolated, comprehensive coverage
  - Integration Tests (20%) - Component interaction validation
  - End-to-End Tests (10%) - Full workflow and user journey validation
  - Test pyramid balance and maintenance strategies
  - Cost-effective testing distribution and optimization

### Testing Types

- **[Testing Types](testing-types.md)** - Comprehensive testing type coverage and implementation
  - Functional testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
  - Non-functional testing (performance, security, accessibility)
  - Specialized testing (usability, compatibility, regression)
  - Testing type selection criteria and implementation guidelines
  - Cross-functional testing coordination and coverage analysis

### Coverage Strategy

- **[Coverage Strategy](coverage-strategy.md)** - Code coverage requirements and quality standards
  - Coverage metrics and threshold requirements (minimum 80% for critical logic)
  - Coverage types (line, branch, function, statement coverage)
  - Coverage reporting and visualization strategies
  - Coverage quality vs quantity balance
  - Coverage gap analysis and improvement strategies

### TDD Approach

- **[TDD Approach](tdd-approach.md)** - Test-Driven Development methodology and implementation
  - Red-Green-Refactor cycle implementation
  - TDD benefits and development workflow integration
  - Unit test design and specification-driven development
  - TDD challenges and adoption strategies
  - TDD tools and framework integration

## 🔗 Related Practices

- **[Testing Implementation](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/testing-implementation/README.md)** - Practical implementation of testing strategies
- **[Code Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/README.md)** - Code design patterns that support testing strategies

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Philosophy Foundation**: Establish [Testing Philosophy](testing-philosophy.md) for team mindset
2. **Strategy Structure**: Implement [Test Pyramid](test-pyramid.md) distribution for balanced testing
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Plan [Testing Types](testing-types.md) for complete validation
4. **Quality Metrics**: Define [Coverage Strategy](coverage-strategy.md) and quality thresholds
5. **Development Integration**: Adopt [TDD Approach](tdd-approach.md) for development workflow
