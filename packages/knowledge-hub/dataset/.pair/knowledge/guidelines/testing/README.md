- Risk-based testing that focuses effort on high-impact areas
- Automated testing that provides fast feedback and regression protection
- Manual testing for user experience validation and exploratory testing

**Test-Driven Quality Culture**
- Testing as an integral part of development process, not an afterthought
- Shared responsibility for quality across development team
- Testing practices that support and enable refactoring and evolution
- Continuous learning and improvement in testing effectiveness

### Efficiency and Sustainability
**Automated Testing Strategy**
- Automation that reduces manual effort while maintaining test effectiveness
- Fast-running test suites that support rapid development cycles
- Reliable tests that build confidence rather than create maintenance overhead
- Strategic automation investment based on value and risk assessment

**Maintainable Testing Practices**
- Test code quality standards that match production code expectations
- Testing patterns that evolve with application architecture and requirements
- Documentation and knowledge sharing that supports team testing capability
- Tool and framework choices that support long-term maintainability

### Risk Management and Confidence
**Quality Assurance Integration**
- Testing strategies aligned with business risk and user impact assessment
- Quality gates that prevent issues from reaching production environments
- Monitoring and alerting that detect issues in production systems
- Rapid feedback loops that enable quick issue detection and resolution
