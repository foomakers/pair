# 🧪 Testing Guidelines

**Focus**: How to verify that software works correctly

Define comprehensive testing approach that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle, aligned with project architecture and development standards.

## 📚 Testing Practices (Level 2)

### Testing Strategy Practice

- **[Testing Strategy](testing-strategy/README.md)** - Testing philosophy, pyramid strategy, and comprehensive approaches
  - Testing philosophy and enhanced testing principles
  - Test pyramid strategy and distribution (Unit 70%, Integration 20%, E2E 10%)
  - Testing types and coverage requirements
  - Test-driven development (TDD) approach and methodologies
  - Coverage strategy and quality standards

### Test Automation Practice

- **[Test Automation](test-automation/README.md)** - Automation frameworks, CI/CD integration, and execution strategies
  - Test automation framework design and implementation
  - CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
  - Test execution strategies and parallel testing
  - Test reporting and metrics generation
  - Automation patterns and best practices

### Testing Implementation Practice

- **[Testing Implementation](testing-implementation/README.md)** - Practical testing implementation across different test types
  - Unit testing implementation and patterns
  - Integration testing strategies and approaches
  - End-to-end testing implementation and tooling
  - Performance testing integration and benchmarking
  - Accessibility testing and compliance validation

### Testing Tools Practice

- **[Testing Tools](testing-tools/README.md)** - Testing frameworks, utilities, and tool configuration
  - Testing framework selection and configuration
  - Testing utilities and assertion libraries
  - Mock tools and test data management
  - Test runners and execution environments
  - Tool integration and workflow optimization

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Testing Foundation**: Establish [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy/README.md) for your approach and philosophy
2. **Automation Setup**: Implement [Test Automation](test-automation/README.md) frameworks and CI/CD integration
3. **Test Implementation**: Apply [Testing Implementation](testing-implementation/README.md) patterns across test types
4. **Tool Configuration**: Configure [Testing Tools](testing-tools/README.md) for your testing ecosystem
