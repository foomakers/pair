# Cloud Provider Evaluation Framework

Strategic framework for evaluating and selecting cloud providers based on technical requirements, business needs, and strategic objectives.

## When to Use

**Essential for:**
- New project cloud provider selection
- Multi-cloud strategy development  
- Cloud migration planning
- Vendor risk assessment and mitigation
- Cost optimization and budget planning
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

**Consider alternatives for:**
- Single-provider locked-in scenarios
- Simple proof-of-concept projects
- Legacy system maintenance without migration plans

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Technical Capabilities Assessment

**Infrastructure Services**
- Compute options (VMs, containers, serverless)
- Storage solutions (object, block, file)
- Database offerings (relational, NoSQL, analytics)
- Networking features (VPC, CDN, load balancing)

**Development & Operations**
- CI/CD pipeline support
- Monitoring and logging capabilities
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Security and compliance features

**Performance & Reliability**
- SLA guarantees and uptime history
- Geographic availability and latency
- Scalability options and limits
- Data transfer capabilities

### 2. Business Factors Analysis

**Cost Structure**
- Pricing models (pay-as-go, reserved, committed)
- Hidden costs and egress fees
- Volume discounts and enterprise pricing
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) projections

**Vendor Relationship**
- Support tiers and response times
- Account management and consulting
- Training and certification programs
- Ecosystem and partner network

**Strategic Alignment**
- Market position and stability
- Innovation roadmap and R&D investment
- Open source contributions and standards
- Lock-in risks and exit strategies

### 3. Risk Assessment Framework

**Operational Risks**
- Service availability and redundancy
- Data sovereignty and jurisdictional issues
- Vendor lock-in and migration complexity
- Compliance and regulatory adherence

**Strategic Risks**
- Market competition and pricing pressure
- Technology obsolescence and modernization
- Acquisition or business model changes
- Geopolitical and regulatory shifts

## Decision Making Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Definition
1. **Business Requirements**

   - Integration and compatibility needs
   - Security and compliance standards
   - Operational and management preferences

### Phase 2: Provider Shortlisting
1. **Market Research**
   - Industry reports and analyst insights
   - Customer case studies and references
   - Community feedback and reviews
   - Vendor presentations and demos

2. **Preliminary Screening**
   - Basic capability matching
   - Cost range assessment
   - Geographic availability check
   - Compliance certification review

### Phase 3: Detailed Evaluation
1. **Technical Assessment**
   - Proof of concept development
   - Performance testing and benchmarking
   - Security and compliance validation
   - Integration testing and compatibility

2. **Commercial Evaluation**
   - Detailed pricing analysis
   - Contract terms and conditions review
   - Support and service level evaluation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation planning

### Phase 4: Decision and Implementation
1. **Selection Criteria Weighting**
   - Business priority alignment
   - Risk tolerance assessment
   - Strategic importance ranking
   - Cost-benefit analysis

2. **Decision Documentation**
   - Evaluation summary and recommendations
   - Risk analysis and mitigation plans
   - Implementation roadmap and timeline
   - Success metrics and review criteria

## Provider Categories

### Hyperscale Providers
**Characteristics:** Global reach, comprehensive services, enterprise focus
**Examples:** AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
**Best for:** Large-scale applications, enterprise workloads, multi-region deployments

### Regional Providers
**Characteristics:** Local presence, regulatory compliance, specialized services
**Examples:** Alibaba Cloud, OVHcloud, DigitalOcean
**Best for:** Regional compliance, cost optimization, specialized requirements

### Specialized Providers
**Characteristics:** Domain expertise, niche services, vertical focus
**Examples:** Snowflake, MongoDB Atlas, Vercel
**Best for:** Specific technologies, developer-focused services, specialized workloads

## Evaluation Best Practices

### Documentation and Tracking
- Maintain detailed evaluation matrices
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Track decision rationale and trade-offs
- Version control evaluation criteria

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Include technical and business stakeholders
- Gather diverse perspectives and requirements
- Validate assumptions with user feedback
- Align on decision criteria and weighting

### Continuous Assessment
- Regular provider performance reviews
- Market landscape monitoring
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Strategic alignment validation

## Common Decision Patterns

### Startup/Small Projects
**Priority:** Cost optimization, developer experience, time to market
**Typical Choice:** Single cloud, platform-as-a-service focus
**Risk Mitigation:** Container-based architecture, cloud-agnostic design

### Enterprise/Mission-Critical
**Priority:** Reliability, compliance, enterprise support
**Typical Choice:** Multi-cloud or hybrid, enterprise agreements
**Risk Mitigation:** Disaster recovery, vendor diversification, exit planning

### Global/Distributed Applications
**Priority:** Geographic coverage, low latency, data sovereignty
**Typical Choice:** Multi-region deployment, edge computing
**Risk Mitigation:** Data replication, regional compliance, performance monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Pilot and Validation
- Start with non-critical workloads
- Implement monitoring and feedback loops
- Validate cost and performance assumptions
- Build operational expertise and processes

### Risk Mitigation
- Design for cloud portability where feasible
- Implement backup and disaster recovery
- Monitor vendor health and market position
- Maintain alternative provider relationships

### Continuous Optimization
- Regular cost and performance reviews
- Technology and service roadmap alignment
- Vendor relationship and contract optimization
- Market opportunity and threat assessment
