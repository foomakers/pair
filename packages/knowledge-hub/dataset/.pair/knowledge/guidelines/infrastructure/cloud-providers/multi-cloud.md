# Multi-Cloud Strategy

Strategic approach to using multiple cloud providers to optimize performance, reduce vendor lock-in, and enhance business resilience.

## When to Use Multi-Cloud

**Strong Indicators:**
- Vendor lock-in risk mitigation requirements
- Geographic or regulatory compliance needs
- Best-of-breed service optimization
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
- Cost optimization through competition
- Merger and acquisition integration

**Reconsider if:**
- Single cloud meets all requirements
- Team lacks multi-cloud expertise
- Operational complexity outweighs benefits
- Budget constraints limit management capabilities

## Multi-Cloud Architecture Patterns

### 1. Distributed Multi-Cloud
**Pattern:** Different applications on different clouds
**Use Case:** Best-of-breed service selection
**Benefits:** Optimize each workload for ideal platform
**Challenges:** Multiple operational models, data integration

### 2. Redundant Multi-Cloud
**Pattern:** Same applications deployed across multiple clouds
**Use Case:** High availability and disaster recovery
**Benefits:** Maximum resilience and uptime
**Challenges:** Data synchronization, cost duplication

### 3. Hybrid Multi-Cloud
**Pattern:** Core services on primary cloud, specialized services elsewhere
**Use Case:** Balanced optimization and risk management
**Benefits:** Primary relationship with secondary capabilities
**Challenges:** Integration complexity, data gravity

### 4. Portable Multi-Cloud
**Pattern:** Container-based applications deployed anywhere
**Use Case:** Maximum flexibility and vendor independence
**Benefits:** Workload portability, negotiation leverage
**Challenges:** Abstraction overhead, lowest common denominator
