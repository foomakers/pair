# 🛠️ Tech Stack (Level 2)

**Focus**: Core technology decisions and framework selection standards

Define the fundamental technology choices and framework standards that form the foundation of the development stack, ensuring consistency and maintainability across projects.

## 📚 Tech Stack Standards (Level 3)

### Core Technologies

- **[Core Technologies](core-technologies.md)** - Fundamental technology stack decisions and architectural choices
  - Frontend & Full-Stack Framework (React 18+, Next.js 14+)
  - Backend for Frontend (BFF) with Next.js API Routes
  - Bounded Context APIs with Fastify
  - Data Layer with PostgreSQL + Prisma and Redis
  - Development Foundation (pnpm, Turbo, Git, Markdown)

### Framework Selection

- **[Framework Selection](framework-selection.md)** - Criteria and process for evaluating and selecting frameworks
  - Development Support and tooling requirements
  - Community Ecosystem and documentation standards
  - Type Safety and reliability considerations
  - Testing Support integration requirements
  - Performance and security alignment criteria

### TypeScript Standards

- **[TypeScript Standards](typescript-standards.md)** - TypeScript configuration and usage standards
  - Version Management across monorepo workspaces
  - TSConfig Configuration and compiler settings
  - Type Safety Principles and best practices
  - Import/Export Conventions and module patterns

### Frontend Stack

- **[Frontend Stack](frontend-stack.md)** - Frontend-specific technology standards and patterns
  - React 18+ patterns and component standards
  - Next.js 14+ configuration and optimization
  - shadcn/ui component library integration
  - Frontend build tools and optimization strategies

### Backend Stack

- **[Backend Stack](backend-stack.md)** - Backend technology standards and API patterns
  - Fastify framework patterns and plugins
  - Node.js runtime optimization and configuration
  - API design patterns and standards
  - Server-side performance and scalability patterns

## 🔗 Related Practices

- **[Cloud Infrastructure](../../cloud-infrastructure/README.md)** - Cloud services and deployment platforms for these technologies
- **[Development Tools](../development-tools/README.md)** - Tools that support these technology choices
- **[Integration Standards](../integration-standards/README.md)** - How these technologies integrate together
- **[Code Design Framework Patterns](../../code-design/framework-patterns/README.md)** - Implementation patterns for these technologies

## ☁️ Cloud Integration

For cloud deployment and infrastructure automation:

- **[Cloud Providers](../../cloud-infrastructure/cloud-providers.md)** - Provider selection for tech stack deployment
- **[Container Orchestration](../../cloud-infrastructure/container-orchestration.md)** - Containerizing and deploying tech stack components
- **[Cloud Databases](../../cloud-infrastructure/cloud-databases.md)** - Managed database services aligned with backend stack
- **[Cloud DevOps](../../cloud-infrastructure/cloud-devops.md)** - CI/CD pipelines for tech stack deployment

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Foundation**: Review [Core Technologies](core-technologies.md) for the complete technology stack
2. **Selection Process**: Use [Framework Selection](framework-selection.md) criteria for new technology choices
3. **TypeScript Setup**: Configure [TypeScript Standards](typescript-standards.md) across your workspace
4. **Frontend Implementation**: Apply [Frontend Stack](frontend-stack.md) patterns for client-side development
5. **Backend Implementation**: Use [Backend Stack](backend-stack.md) standards for server-side development
