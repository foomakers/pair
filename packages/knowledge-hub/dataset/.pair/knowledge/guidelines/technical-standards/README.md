# 🔧 Technical Standards Guidelines

**Focus**: What technologies to use and how to configure them

Define comprehensive technical standards including tech stack, tools, frameworks, and integration requirements that support the development process.

## 📚 Technical Standards Practices (Level 2)

### Tech Stack Practice

- **[Tech Stack](tech-stack/README.md)** - Core technology decisions and framework selection standards
  - Frontend and full-stack framework standards (React, Next.js)
  - Backend framework standards (Fastify)
  - Database and data layer technologies (PostgreSQL, Redis)
  - TypeScript standards and configuration
  - Framework selection criteria and evaluation

### Development Tools Practice

- **[Development Tools](development-tools/README.md)** - Development environment and tooling standards
  - Required and recommended development tools
  - IDE configuration and setup standards
  - AI-assisted development integration
  - Development environment standardization
  - Tool version management and consistency

### Integration Standards Practice

- **[Integration Standards](integration-standards/README.md)** - API design, data management, and external service integration
  - API design principles and implementation standards
  - Database integration and data management patterns
  - External service integration strategies
  - Error handling and resilience patterns
  - Internationalization and localization standards

### Deployment Workflow Practice

- **[Deployment Workflow](deployment-workflow/README.md)** - Release management, workflow, and deployment standards
  - Versioning strategy and semantic versioning
  - Feature flag management and lifecycle
  - Git workflow and branching strategies
  - Build, release, and deployment standards
  - Quality assurance and validation processes

- **[Testing](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/README.md)** - Testing frameworks and tools supporting technical standards
- **[Architecture Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/architecture/README.md)** - Architectural decisions that inform technical choices

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Foundation Setup**: Configure [Tech Stack](tech-stack/README.md) for your technology foundation
2. **Development Environment**: Set up [Development Tools](development-tools/README.md) for your team
3. **Integration Patterns**: Implement [Integration Standards](integration-standards/README.md) for system connections
4. **Release Management**: Establish [Deployment Workflow](deployment-workflow/README.md) for delivery processes

_Technical Standards focuses on the "what" and "with what" of software development - the technologies, tools, and configurations that enable effective development._
