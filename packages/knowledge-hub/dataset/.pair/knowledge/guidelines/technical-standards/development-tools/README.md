# 🔧 Development Tools (Level 2)

**Focus**: Development environment and tooling standards

Define the tools, IDE configurations, and development environment standards that enable efficient and consistent development workflows across the team.

## 📚 Development Tools Standards (Level 3)

### Required Tools

- **[Required Tools](required-tools.md)** - Essential development tools that must be used across the team
  - IDE/Editor requirements and configuration standards
  - Package Manager (pnpm) for consistent dependency management
  - Build Tools (Turbo) for monorepo optimization and caching
  - Git version control with conventional commit standards
  - Linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
  - Type Checking with TypeScript strict mode

### Recommended Tools

- **[Recommended Tools](recommended-tools.md)** - Additional tools that enhance development productivity
  - Next.js DevTools for development server and debugging
  - React Developer Tools for browser-based debugging
  - TypeScript Support with language server and IntelliSense
  - Tailwind CSS Support for shadcn/ui development
  - Static Analysis tools integration
  - API Testing tools for development and validation

### AI-Assisted Development

- **AI-Assisted Development** - AI tool integration and development workflow enhancement
  - AI Tool Integration (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, similar tools)
  - MCP Integration for context sharing and development assistance
  - Documentation Standards for AI-readable code context
  - llms.txt Implementation for API documentation
  - AI workflow optimization and best practices

### IDE Configuration
