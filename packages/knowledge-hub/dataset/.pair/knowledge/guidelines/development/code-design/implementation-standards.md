# ⚙️ Implementation Standards

Development environment setup, function design, error handling, and performance considerations for consistent implementation practices.

## Purpose

Define practical implementation standards that support maintainable development through proper environment setup, function design, and error handling patterns.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Development environment independence
- Function design principles
- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations
- Service abstraction patterns

**Out of Scope:**
- Quality enforcement automation (see [Quality Standards](../quality-standards/))
- Framework-specific implementations (see [Framework Patterns](../framework-patterns/))
- Code organization patterns (see [Organization Patterns](../organization-patterns/))

## Implementation Guides

- **[Development Environment](development-environment.md)** - Local development independence and service management
- **[Function Design](function-design.md)** - Function design principles and patterns
- **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** - Consistent error handling strategies
- **[Performance](performance.md)** - Performance considerations and optimization patterns
