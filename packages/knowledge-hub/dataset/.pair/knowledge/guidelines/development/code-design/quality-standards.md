# 🔧 Quality Standards

Automated code quality enforcement through ESLint, Prettier, metrics, and quality gates.

## Purpose

Define and enforce code quality standards through automated tools, metrics, and quality gates that ensure consistent code quality across the codebase.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- ESLint configurations and rules
- Prettier formatting standards
- Quality metrics and thresholds
- Automated quality gates and checks

**Out of Scope:**
- Manual code review processes (see [Implementation Standards](../implementation-standards/))
- Design principle definitions (see [Design Principles](../design-principles.md))
- Framework-specific patterns (see [Framework Patterns](../framework-patterns/))

## Implementation Guides

- **[ESLint Configuration](eslint.md)** - Shared and project-specific ESLint setups
- **[Prettier Configuration](prettier.md)** - Code formatting standards and configurations
- **[Quality Metrics](metrics.md)** - Coverage thresholds, complexity analysis, and automated gates
