# 📁 Organization Patterns

File structure, workspace architecture, dependency management, and TypeScript configuration standards for scalable code organization.

## Purpose

Define organizational patterns for file structure, workspace architecture, and dependency management that support maintainable and scalable codebases.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- File structure and naming conventions
- Workspace and feature-based architecture
- Dependency management with PNPM
- TypeScript configuration standards
- Monorepo organization patterns

**Out of Scope:**
- Framework-specific implementations (see [Framework Patterns](../framework-patterns/))
- Quality enforcement tools (see [Quality Standards](../quality-standards/))
- Development environment setup (see [Implementation Standards](../implementation-standards/))

## Implementation Guides

- **[File Structure](file-structure.md)** - File organization and naming conventions
- **[Workspace Structure](workspace-structure.md)** - Feature-based architecture and monorepo organization
- **[Dependency Management](dependency-management.md)** - PNPM workspace configuration and version management
- **[TypeScript Standards](typescript-standards.md)** - TypeScript configuration and type safety principles
