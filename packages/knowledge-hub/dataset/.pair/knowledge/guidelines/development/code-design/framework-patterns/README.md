# 🏗️ Framework Patterns

Framework-specific implementation patterns and best practices for React/Next.js, Fastify, and other core technologies.

## Purpose

Define consistent implementation patterns for specific frameworks to ensure maintainable, performant, and idiomatic code across the technology stack.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- React/Next.js component patterns and hooks
- Fastify service architecture and API patterns
- TypeScript integration patterns
- Framework-specific best practices

**Out of Scope:**
- Technology selection criteria (see [Technical Standards](../../technical-standards/))
- General design principles (see [Design Principles](../design-principles.md))
- Quality enforcement tools (see [Quality Standards](../quality-standards/))

## Implementation Guides

- **[React/Next.js Patterns](react-nextjs.md)** - Component patterns, hooks, and state management
- **[Fastify Patterns](fastify.md)** - Service architecture, routing, and API design
