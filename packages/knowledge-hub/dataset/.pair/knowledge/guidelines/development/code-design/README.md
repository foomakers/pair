# 💻 Code Design Practice (Level 2)

Code organization patterns, design principles, and implementation standards for maintainable software development.

## Purpose

Define code structure, design patterns, and implementation standards that ensure high code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Code structure and design patterns
- Implementation standards and best practices
- Framework-specific patterns (React/Next.js, TypeScript)
- Code readability and maintainability guidelines
- Design principles and coding conventions

**Out of Scope:**

- Infrastructure and deployment configurations (see [Infrastructure](../../../operations/infrastructure/README.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](../../../quality/performance/README.md))
- Security implementation details (see [Security](../../../quality/security/README.md))
- Testing frameworks and strategies (see [Testing](../testing/README.md))
- Third-party library integration patterns (see [Technical Standards](../technical-standards/README.md))

## Level 2 Implementation Areas

  - Fastify service and API patterns
  - TypeScript type design patterns

### Code Quality Standards

- **[Quality Standards](quality-standards/)** - Automated quality enforcement and standards
  - ESLint and Prettier configurations
  - Quality metrics and thresholds
  - Automated quality gates

### Implementation Standards

- **[Implementation Standards](implementation-standards/)** - Development environment and implementation guidelines
  - Development environment setup
  - Function design principles
  - Error handling patterns
