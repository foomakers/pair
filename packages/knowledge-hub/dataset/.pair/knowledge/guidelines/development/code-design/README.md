# 💻 Code Design Practice (Level 2)

Code organization patterns, design principles, and implementation standards for maintainable software development.

## Purpose

Define code structure, design patterns, and implementation standards that ensure high code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Code structure and design patterns
- Implementation standards and best practices
- Framework-specific patterns (React/Next.js, TypeScript)
- Code readability and maintainability guidelines
- Design principles and coding conventions

**Out of Scope:**

- Infrastructure and deployment configurations (see [Infrastructure](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/operations/infrastructure.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/performance.md))
- Security implementation details (see [Security](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/security.md))
- Testing frameworks and strategies (see [Testing](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/development/testing/README.md))
- Third-party library integration patterns (see [Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/development/technical-standards/README.md))
