# ⚙️ Technical Standards Practice (Level 2)

Comprehensive technical standards including tech stack, tools, frameworks, and integration requirements that support the development process.

## Purpose

Define technical standards, framework selection criteria, and integration requirements that ensure consistent, maintainable, and scalable technical implementations.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Tech stack standards and framework selection
- Development tools and environment setup
- Integration requirements with external systems
- Technical standards and conventions
- Tool versioning and compatibility guidelines

**Out of Scope:**

- Business logic implementation details (see [Code Design](../code-design/README.md))
- Specific coding patterns and design principles (see [Code Design](../code-design/README.md))
- Infrastructure provisioning and deployment (see [Infrastructure](../../operations/infrastructure.md))
- Security policies and compliance procedures (see [Security](../../quality/security.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](../../quality/performance.md))

## Level 2 Implementation Areas

### Technology Stack and Frameworks

- **[Tech Stack](tech-stack/)** - Core technologies, framework selection, and technology standards
  - Frontend and full-stack frameworks (React, Next.js)
  - Backend frameworks and APIs (Fastify, API patterns)
  - Data layer and persistence strategies
  - Framework selection criteria

### Development Tools and Environment

- **[Development Tools](development-tools/)** - Required and recommended development tools and environment setup
  - Required development tools and IDE setup
  - Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
  - AI-assisted development integration
  - Version control and collaboration tools

### Integration Standards and APIs

- **[Integration Standards](integration-standards/)** - Integration patterns, API standards, and external system requirements
  - Internal integration patterns and data flow
  - API design principles and implementation standards
  - Data management and database standards
  - External integrations and third-party services

### Deployment and Workflow Standards

- **[Deployment Workflow](deployment-workflow/)** - Development workflow, versioning, and deployment standards
  - Git workflow and version management
  - Feature flag management and deployment strategies
  - Quality assurance and testing integration
  - Build and release standards
