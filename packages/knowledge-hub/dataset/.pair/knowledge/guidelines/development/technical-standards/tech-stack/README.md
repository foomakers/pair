# 🛠️ Tech Stack Standards

Core technologies, framework selection criteria, and technology standards for consistent development stack.

## Purpose

Define the core technology stack, framework selection criteria, and technical standards that ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability across all development efforts.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Frontend and full-stack framework standards
- Backend framework and API technology choices
- Data layer and persistence strategies
- Framework selection criteria and evaluation

**Out of Scope:**
- Development tool setup (see [Development Tools](../development-tools/))
- Integration patterns (see [Integration Standards](../integration-standards/))
- Deployment processes (see [Deployment Workflow](../deployment-workflow/))

## Implementation Guides

- **[Core Technologies](core-technologies.md)** - Primary technology stack and framework selections
- **[Framework Selection](framework-selection.md)** - Criteria and process for evaluating and selecting frameworks
