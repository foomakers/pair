# 📦 Integration Standards

Integration patterns, API standards, data management, and external system requirements.

## Purpose

Define integration patterns, API design standards, and data management strategies that ensure consistent, scalable, and maintainable system integrations.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Internal integration patterns and data flow
- API design principles and implementation standards
- Data management and database standards
- External integrations and third-party services
- Authentication and authorization patterns

**Out of Scope:**
- Infrastructure deployment (see [Infrastructure](../../../operations/infrastructure/))
- Security implementation details (see [Security](../../../quality/security/))
- Performance optimization (see [Performance](../../../quality/performance/))

## Implementation Guides
