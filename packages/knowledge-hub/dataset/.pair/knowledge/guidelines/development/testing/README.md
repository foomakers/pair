# 🧪 Testing Practice (Level 2)

Comprehensive testing strategies, implementation patterns, automation frameworks, and testing tools for reliable software quality assurance.

## Purpose

Define testing strategies, implementation patterns, and automation frameworks that ensure comprehensive quality assurance and reliable software delivery.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Testing strategies and methodologies
- Test implementation patterns and best practices
- Test automation frameworks and CI/CD integration
- Testing tools and environment setup
- Quality metrics and coverage standards

**Out of Scope:**

- Code design patterns (see [Code Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/development/code-design/README.md))
- Performance optimization strategies (see [Performance](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/performance.md))
- Security testing implementation (see [Security](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/security.md))
- Infrastructure testing (see [Infrastructure](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/operations/infrastructure.md))
