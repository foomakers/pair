# 💻 Development Guidelines (Level 1)

Code design, technical standards, and testing strategies for high-quality software development.

## 📚 Development Practices (Level 2)

### Code Design Practice

- **[Code Design](code-design/README.md)** - Code organization patterns, design principles, and implementation standards
  - Core code design guidelines and patterns
  - Component design and reusability strategies
  - Error handling and resilience patterns

### Technical Standards Practice

- **[Technical Standards](technical-standards/README.md)** - Technology stack decisions and development tool configuration
  - Technical guidelines and stack decisions
  - Development environment standardization
  - Feature flag management and deployment strategies

### Testing Practice

- **[Testing](testing/README.md)** - Testing strategies, frameworks, and quality gates
  - Comprehensive testing strategy and approaches
  - Testing frameworks and automation
  - Quality gates and coverage standards

## 🛠️ Level 3: Tool-Specific Implementations

_Each practice folder contains tool-specific guides and implementations:_

- Framework-specific development patterns
- Testing tool configurations and guides
- Development environment setup guides

## 🔗 Related Guidelines

- **[Quality Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/README.md)** - Quality criteria and standards for code validation
- **[Operations Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/operations/README.md)** - Infrastructure considerations for development

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Code Design**: Start with [Code Design](code-design) for organization patterns and design principles
2. **Technical Setup**: Configure development environment using [Technical Standards](technical-standards)
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing with [Testing](testing) practices
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure compliance with [Quality Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/standards)
