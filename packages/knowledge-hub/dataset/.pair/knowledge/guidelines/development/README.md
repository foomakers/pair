# 💻 Development Guidelines

Code design, technical standards, and testing strategies for high-quality software development.

## 📚 Development Practices

### Code & Design

- **[Code Design Guidelines](code-design-guidelines.md)** - Code organization, design patterns, and implementation standards
  - Code organization and structure
  - Design patterns and architectural principles
  - Component design and reusability
  - Error handling and resilience patterns

### Technical Standards

- **[Technical Guidelines](technical-guidelines.md)** - Tech stack, development tools, and feature flag management
  - Technology stack decisions
  - Development tool configuration
  - Feature flag management
  - Development environment setup

### Testing & Quality

- **[Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)** - Testing frameworks, strategies, and quality gates
  - Test-driven development approach
  - Testing frameworks and tools
  - Quality gates and coverage standards
  - Integration and end-to-end testing
