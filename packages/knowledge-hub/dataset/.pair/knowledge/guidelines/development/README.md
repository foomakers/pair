# 💻 Development Guidelines

This directory contains three specialized development practice areas, reorganized from the previous consolidated development guidelines.

## 📚 Development Practice Areas

The development guidelines are organized into three specialized areas that work together to ensure high-quality software development:

### 🎨 Code Design

**Focus**: How to write high-quality, maintainable code

- **[Code Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/README.md)** - Code organization patterns, design principles, and implementation standards
  - Design principles and code quality standards
  - Framework-specific patterns and implementations
  - Code organization and workspace structure
  - Quality gates and technical debt management

### 🔧 Technical Standards

**Focus**: What technologies to use and how to configure them

- **[Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/README.md)** - Technology stack decisions and development tool configuration
  - Tech stack selection and framework standards
  - Development tools and environment setup
  - Integration patterns and API standards
  - Deployment workflows and feature flag management

### 🧪 Testing

**Focus**: How to verify that software works correctly

- **[Testing](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/README.md)** - Testing strategies, frameworks, and quality gates
  - Testing philosophy and strategic approaches
  - Test automation frameworks and implementation
  - Testing tools and quality standards
  - Coverage requirements and quality gates

## � Relationship Between Practice Areas

These three areas work together in the development workflow:

1. **Technical Standards** → Define the foundation (what technologies and tools to use)
2. **Code Design** → Define the implementation approach (how to write quality code with those tools)
3. **Testing** → Validate the implementation (verify that the code works correctly)

## 🔗 Related Guidelines

- **[Architecture Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/architecture/README.md)** - Architectural patterns that guide development practices
- **[Quality Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/README.md)** - Quality criteria and standards for development validation
- **[Operations Guidelines](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/operations/README.md)** - Infrastructure and deployment considerations

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Technical Setup**: Start with [Technical Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/README.md) to configure your development environment
2. **Code Implementation**: Follow [Code Design](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/code-design/README.md) patterns and principles
3. **Quality Validation**: Implement [Testing](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/README.md) strategies to ensure quality
4. **Quality Gates**: Apply [Quality Standards](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality/standards/README.md) for completion criteria
