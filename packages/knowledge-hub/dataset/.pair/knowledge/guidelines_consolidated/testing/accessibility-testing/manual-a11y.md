# Manual Accessibility Testing

## Evaluation Methodology

### Systematic Assessment Approach

Manual accessibility testing requires systematic evaluation procedures that ensure comprehensive coverage of accessibility features and user experience aspects. Structured approaches prevent oversight of critical accessibility elements while maintaining testing efficiency.

Develop evaluation checklists that cover WCAG success criteria, assistive technology compatibility, and user experience considerations. Systematic evaluation ensures consistent testing quality and comprehensive accessibility validation.

### User-Centered Testing Perspective

Approach manual accessibility testing from the perspective of users with different abilities and assistive technology needs. This user-centered approach helps identify practical accessibility barriers that automated testing might miss.

Consider different user scenarios including keyboard-only navigation, screen reader usage, voice control interaction, and various visual impairment accommodations. Each user scenario may reveal different accessibility challenges and requirements.

## Testing Procedures

### Keyboard Navigation Testing

Conduct comprehensive keyboard navigation testing including tab order validation, focus management verification, and keyboard shortcut functionality. Keyboard accessibility is fundamental for many assistive technology users.

Test all interactive elements including buttons, links, form controls, and complex components such as menus and modal dialogs. Ensure that keyboard navigation follows logical patterns and provides clear visual focus indicators.

Validate that users can access all functionality using only the keyboard, including opening and closing interactive elements, navigating within complex components, and completing all available actions.

### Screen Reader Testing

Test applications with actual screen reader software to validate content structure, navigation efficiency, and information clarity. Screen reader testing provides insight into the auditory user experience and identifies content organization issues.

Evaluate content announcement quality including heading structure, landmark navigation, alternative text effectiveness, and form labeling clarity. Screen readers rely on well-structured content to provide efficient navigation and comprehension.

Test dynamic content updates, error message announcements, and interactive component state changes to ensure screen readers communicate important information appropriately to users.

### Color and Visual Testing

Evaluate color usage, contrast ratios, and visual design elements that affect accessibility for users with various visual impairments. Visual accessibility testing ensures information remains accessible across different vision capabilities.

Test interfaces with color vision simulation tools to identify instances where color alone conveys important information. Ensure that alternative indicators such as text, symbols, or patterns provide the same information.

Validate text readability under various lighting conditions and zoom levels to ensure content remains accessible for users with different visual needs and environmental constraints.

## Assistive Technology Testing

### Screen Reader Compatibility

Test with multiple screen reader applications including NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver to ensure broad compatibility. Different screen readers may interpret content differently, requiring validation across multiple tools.

Evaluate navigation efficiency including heading navigation, landmark jumping, and content skipping capabilities. Efficient navigation is crucial for screen reader users to access information quickly and effectively.

### Voice Control Testing

Test voice control software compatibility including command recognition, navigation accuracy, and interaction efficiency. Voice control testing validates accessibility for users with motor impairments who rely on speech input.

Evaluate voice control scenarios including form completion, link activation, and complex interaction patterns. Voice control users need reliable and predictable interaction patterns to use applications effectively.

### Magnification Software Testing

Test screen magnification software compatibility including content visibility, navigation tracking, and interaction accuracy. Magnification testing ensures accessibility for users with low vision who need content enlargement.

Validate that magnified content remains usable including text readability, interface element accessibility, and navigation efficiency. Magnification users need consistent and predictable layouts that work well at various zoom levels.

## Usability Evaluation

### Task Completion Assessment

Evaluate whether users with different abilities can complete common tasks efficiently and effectively using assistive technologies. Task completion assessment provides practical insight into real-world accessibility effectiveness.

Design task scenarios that reflect typical user goals and workflows. Evaluate completion rates, error frequencies, and satisfaction levels for users employing different assistive technologies and accessibility features.

### Error Prevention and Recovery

Test error prevention mechanisms and recovery procedures to ensure users with disabilities can identify, understand, and recover from errors effectively. Error handling is particularly important for users who may rely on assistive technologies.

Validate that error messages are clearly announced by screen readers, visible to users with various visual capabilities, and provide sufficient guidance for error resolution.

### Documentation and Help Systems

Evaluate accessibility of help documentation, tutorials, and support resources. Accessibility support materials must themselves be accessible to users who need them most.

Test documentation compatibility with assistive technologies and evaluate whether help content addresses accessibility-specific usage patterns and requirements.

## Testing Documentation

### Issue Documentation Standards

Document accessibility issues with sufficient detail to enable effective resolution including specific locations, user impact descriptions, and suggested remediation approaches. Clear documentation facilitates efficient issue resolution.

Include screenshots, screen reader output examples, and step-by-step reproduction instructions to help developers understand and resolve accessibility barriers effectively.

### Testing Evidence Collection

Collect comprehensive evidence of accessibility testing including screenshots, video recordings of assistive technology interactions, and detailed test result documentation. Evidence supports accessibility compliance validation and guides improvement efforts.

### Progress Tracking and Reporting

Implement systematic tracking of accessibility testing progress, issue resolution status, and compliance improvement trends. Progress tracking helps prioritize accessibility work and demonstrates improvement over time.
