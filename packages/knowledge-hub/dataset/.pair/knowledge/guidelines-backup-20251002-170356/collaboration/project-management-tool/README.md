# Project Management Tool Framework

## Strategic Overview

This framework establishes systematic project management tool orchestration through platform evaluation, implementation optimization, and workflow integration that enables teams to select, adopt, and maximize the effectiveness of project management solutions across diverse organizational contexts and project requirements.

This section provides comprehensive tool setup guides and serves as a navigation hub to help teams choose, configure, and integrate project management tools across all collaboration topics.

## Tool Selection

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria           | GitHub      | Filesystem | Future Tools |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **Team Size**      | 1-50+       | 1-10       | TBD          |
| **Complexity**     | Medium-High | Low-Medium | TBD          |
| **Integration**    | Excellent   | Basic      | TBD          |
| **Cost**           | Free-Paid   | Free       | TBD          |
| **Learning Curve** | Medium      | Low        | TBD          |

### Context-Based Recommendations

- **Small teams (1-5)**: Filesystem or GitHub Projects
- **Medium teams (5-15)**: GitHub Projects recommended
- **Large teams (15+)**: GitHub Projects or enterprise tools
- **Remote teams**: GitHub Projects for better collaboration
- **Local teams**: Filesystem acceptable for simple workflows

## Tool Implementation Guides

### Available Tools

- **[GitHub Implementation](github-implementation.md)**: Complete GitHub Projects setup and workflow integration
- **[Filesystem Implementation](filesystem-implementation.md)**: Local filesystem-based project management setup

### GitHub Tool

- **[github-tool.md](github-tool.md)** - Complete GitHub setup and cross-topic navigation
  - MCP server setup and authentication
  - GitHub Projects configuration
  - Cross-references to all GitHub-related topics

### Filesystem Tool

- **[filesystem-tool.md](filesystem-tool.md)** - Complete filesystem setup and cross-topic navigation
  - Directory structure setup
  - Local automation scripts
  - Cross-references to all filesystem-related topics

## Cross-Topic Integration

Each tool guide provides navigation to:

- **Issue Management**: Tool-specific issue workflows
- **Project Tracking**: Board and progress tracking setup
- **Automation**: Tool automation and integration options
- **Board Management**: Board optimization and management
- **Estimation**: Tool-specific estimation approaches
- **Communication**: Tool-specific communication workflows

## Future Tool Extensions

Planned additions:

- **Azure DevOps**: Enterprise Microsoft integration
