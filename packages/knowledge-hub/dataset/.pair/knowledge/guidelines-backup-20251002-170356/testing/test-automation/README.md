# 🤖 Test Automation (Level 2)

**Focus**: Automation frameworks, CI/CD integration, and execution strategies

Define frameworks and processes for automating testing workflows, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and managing test execution at scale.

## 📚 Test Automation (Level 3)

### Automation Framework

- **[Automation Framework](automation-framework.md)** - Test automation architecture and framework design
  - Test automation architecture and design patterns
  - Framework selection criteria and evaluation
  - Test automation best practices and patterns
  - Framework customization and extension strategies
  - Cross-platform and cross-browser automation support

### CI/CD Integration

- **[CI/CD Integration](ci-cd-integration.md)** - Continuous integration and deployment testing integration
  - CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
  - Test execution in different environments (dev, staging, production)
  - Test result reporting and failure notification
  - Parallel test execution and optimization strategies
  - Test environment provisioning and cleanup

### Test Execution

- **[Test Execution](test-execution.md)** - Test execution strategies and optimization
  - Test execution planning and scheduling
  - Parallel test execution and resource management
  - Test execution monitoring and logging
  - Test execution optimization and performance tuning
  - Test execution result analysis and reporting

### Test Reporting

- **[Test Reporting](test-reporting.md)** - Test results reporting and metrics visualization
  - Test result reporting formats and standards
  - Test metrics collection and analysis
  - Test result visualization and dashboards
  - Test failure analysis and debugging support
  - Historical test data tracking and trends

### Automation Patterns

- **[Automation Patterns](automation-patterns.md)** - Common automation patterns and best practices

- **[Testing Tools](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/testing/testing-tools/README.md)** - Tools that enable automation frameworks
- **[Deployment Workflow](.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/deployment-workflow/README.md)** - CI/CD integration patterns

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Framework Setup**: Establish [Automation Framework](automation-framework.md) architecture and design
2. **Pipeline Integration**: Configure [CI/CD Integration](ci-cd-integration.md) for continuous testing
3. **Execution Management**: Optimize [Test Execution](test-execution.md) strategies and performance
4. **Results Tracking**: Implement [Test Reporting](test-reporting.md) and metrics collection
5. **Pattern Application**: Apply [Automation Patterns](automation-patterns.md) for maintainable automation
