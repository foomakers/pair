# Performance Guidelines

This practice area covers comprehensive performance optimization guidelines for delivering high-performance digital products across all system layers.

## Overview

Performance optimization ensures applications deliver optimal user experience through efficient resource utilization, fast response times, and scalable architecture. This includes frontend optimization, backend efficiency, database performance, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Topics Covered

### Frontend Performance

Client-side performance optimization strategies

- Bundle optimization and code splitting
- Image and asset optimization
- Critical rendering path optimization
- Browser caching strategies
- Progressive web app performance
- Core Web Vitals optimization

### Backend Performance

Server-side performance and optimization

- API response time optimization
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Asynchronous processing patterns
- Load balancing and scaling strategies
- Resource pooling and connection management

### Database Performance

Database optimization and query performance
