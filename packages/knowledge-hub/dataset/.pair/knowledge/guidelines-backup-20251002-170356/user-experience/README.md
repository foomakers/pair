# 🎨 User Experience Guidelines (Level 1)

User experience design, interface design patterns, design systems, and content strategy for intuitive, accessible, and effective user-centered design.

## Purpose

Define user experience design principles, interface patterns, and content strategies that ensure intuitive, accessible, and effective user interfaces and experiences across all digital touchpoints.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Design systems and component libraries
- User experience principles and patterns
- Interface design standards and guidelines
- Content strategy and information architecture
- User research and validation methodologies

**Out of Scope:**

- Implementation details (see [Code Design](../code-design/README.md))
- Accessibility implementation (see [Quality/Accessibility](../quality/accessibility.md))
- Performance optimization (see [Quality/Performance](../quality/performance.md))
- Technical implementation standards (see [Technical Standards](../technical-standards/README.md))

## 📚 User Experience Practices (Level 2)

### Design Systems Practice

- **[Design Systems](design-systems.md)** - Design system architecture, component libraries, and design tokens
  - Design system architecture and governance
  - Component library development and maintenance
  - Design token systems and theming
  - Brand integration and visual identity

### Interface Design Practice

- **[Interface Design](interface-design.md)** - UI design patterns, layout principles, and visual standards
  - Interface design patterns and conventions
  - Layout systems and responsive design
  - Typography and visual hierarchy
  - Interaction design and micro-interactions

### User Research Practice

- **[User Research](user-research.md)** - User research methods, testing, and validation strategies
  - User research and testing methodologies
  - Usability testing and validation
  - User analytics and behavior analysis
  - Accessibility testing and inclusive design

### Content Strategy Practice

- **[Content Strategy](content-strategy.md)** - Content guidelines, information architecture, and communication design
  - Content strategy and planning
  - Information architecture and navigation
  - Writing guidelines and tone of voice
  - Content accessibility and internationalization

## 🛠️ Level 3: Tool-Specific Implementations

_Each practice area contains tool-specific guides and implementations:_

- **Design tools**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Framer
- **Component libraries**: Storybook, shadcn/ui, Headless UI, Chakra UI
- **CSS frameworks**: Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, Emotion, CSS Modules
- **User research tools**: Hotjar, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, User Testing
- **Content management**: Contentful, Strapi, Sanity, Markdown

- **[Quality/Accessibility](../quality/accessibility.md)** - Accessibility standards for inclusive design
- **[Code Design](../code-design/README.md)** - Implementation patterns for design systems
- **[Technical Standards](../technical-standards/README.md)** - Technology stack supporting design implementation
- **[Platform Operations](../platform-operations/README.md)** - Operations supporting UX infrastructure

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Design Foundation**: Establish [Design Systems](design-systems.md) for consistent visual language
2. **Interface Standards**: Implement [Interface Design](interface-design.md) patterns for intuitive interactions
3. **User Validation**: Deploy [User Research](user-research.md) methods for data-driven design decisions
4. **Content Excellence**: Apply [Content Strategy](content-strategy.md) for effective communication
