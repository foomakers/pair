# Bounded Context Catalog (Grouped)

This catalog adopts a grouped approach to bounded context definition, tailored for a small team working on the [PROJECT_NAME] project. The grouping is based on business and technical cohesion, minimizing overhead and maximizing collaboration.

## Why This Grouping?

With only one team of two people, managing many separate bounded contexts would create unnecessary complexity and coordination overhead. By grouping related subdomains into broader bounded contexts, we:

This approach is ideal for small teams, where maximizing collaboration and minimizing management effort is critical. As the project or team expands, contexts can be refined for greater autonomy.

## Bounded Contexts and Subdomain Mapping

### [BOUNDED CONTEXT NAME]

- **Subdomains:** [LIST OF RELATED SUBDOMAINS]
- **Description:** [DESCRIPTION OF THE BOUNDED CONTEXT].
- See details: _link to context file once created_

- This structure ensures that changes in one area (e.g., workflow or standards) are consistently reflected across related activities.

This catalog is designed for simplicity and effectiveness in a small team environment. For more details, see the individual context files linked above.
