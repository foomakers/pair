/**
 * Conformance guard for `/pair-capability-setup-pm` — the PM-tool configuration skill (story #321).
 *
 * TARGET ARTIFACT, NOT STORY (ADL `2026-07-18-conformance-test-per-file-not-per-story.md`):
 * this file is the home of every checkable claim about `setup-pm/SKILL.md`, in both corpora
 * — the dataset (authoring source of truth) and the generated `.claude/skills/**` mirror.
 * A later story adding a setup-pm claim extends a `describe` here rather than adding a file.
 * The last block additionally covers the Azure adapter's `### Adoption Configuration` snippet
 * and its hand-maintained website twin: those two are not a *new* target so much as the
 * other half of ONE contract — the fields setup-pm must write into `way-of-working.md` —
 * and splitting them from the skill that writes them is exactly the fragmentation the ADL
 * rejects. The cross-cutting `pm-tool-adapter-contract.test.ts` stays reserved for the
 * invariant that spans EVERY adapter (visibility); an Azure-only claim does not belong there.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The skill drifted against itself: #389 added Azure DevOps and Linear to the
 * Step 2 selection table and the Step 3 guide list, but `## Notes` kept asserting
 * "Supported tools with implementation guides: GitHub Projects, Filesystem" — two screens
 * below a table offering four. Nothing on the gate could see it, because the supported-tools
 * claim was prose nobody compared against the adapters actually shipped on disk.
 *
 * DATA-DRIVEN BY CONSTRUCTION, NO ADAPTER COUNT ASSERTED. The adapter set is discovered from
 * disk (`*-implementation.md`) in both corpora and the tool's display name is read from the
 * adapter's own pinned H1 (`# <Name> - Complete Implementation Guide`) — so no name table is
 * maintained here either. THE INTENDED CONTRACT FOR THE NEXT AUTHOR: the day a 5th adapter
 * lands (say `gitlab-implementation.md`), these cases go red until `setup-pm/SKILL.md` lists
 * it in all three places. That is the guard working, not a mystery failure — the remedy is to
 * enroll the tool in the skill (Step 2 table row + Step 3 guide link + the Notes line), never
 * to relax the assertion. An adapter whose H1 does not carry the pinned form fails loudly for
 * the same reason: a silently-unparsed name would make every claim below vacuously true.
 *
 * Every assertion in this file was injection-tested — the claim was deleted from the artifact
 * and the assertion confirmed to redden — per the vacuous-assertion lesson recorded in
 * `pm-tool-adapter-contract.test.ts`.
