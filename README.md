## Quick Start

```bash
npx @foomakers/pair-cli install
```

This installs the pair Knowledge Base into your project. Your AI assistant reads `.pair/` and `.claude/skills/` to follow your team's standards, process, and architecture decisions.

## What You Get

- **Knowledge Base** — guidelines, how-to guides, and templates for every SDLC phase
- **Agent Skills** — 30 idempotent workflows following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard
- **Adoption Files** — project-specific decisions (architecture, tech stack, way of working)
- **AI-friendly index** — `.pair/llms.txt` for machine-readable KB discovery ([llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org))
