description: Complete catalog of all 33 pair skills organized by type — process, capability, and meta.
---

pair ships with 33 skills organized into three types: **process** (workflow orchestration), **capability** (atomic operations), and **meta** (navigation). Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file invoked as a slash command by your AI coding assistant.

## Meta Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |

| **plan-stories** | `/pair-process-plan-stories` | Breaks epics into user stories using vertical slicing and INVEST validation. | `/pair-capability-write-issue` |
| **refine-story** | `/pair-process-refine-story` | Refines a user story from Todo to Refined state: requirements analysis (Given-When-Then), technical analysis, sprint readiness. | `/pair-capability-write-issue` |
| **plan-tasks** | `/pair-process-plan-tasks` | Breaks a refined user story into implementation tasks. Appends Technical Analysis + Task Breakdown to the story body. | `/pair-capability-write-issue` |
| **implement** | `/pair-process-implement` | Implements a user story by iterating through its tasks one at a time following a 5-step cycle per task. Creates a PR at story completion. | `/pair-capability-verify-quality`, `/pair-capability-record-decision` |
| **review** | `/pair-process-review` | Reviews a pull request through a structured 6-phase process: validation, technical review, adoption compliance, completeness, decision, and optional merge. | `/pair-capability-verify-quality`, `/pair-capability-verify-done`, `/pair-capability-record-decision`, `/pair-capability-assess-debt` (required); `/pair-capability-verify-adoption`, `/pair-capability-assess-stack`, `/pair-capability-execute-manual-tests` (optional) |

## Capability Skills

Capability skills are atomic operations invoked independently or composed by process skills.

### Assessment Capabilities

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| **assess-ai** | `/pair-capability-assess-ai` | Assess AI development tools using resolution cascade (Argument > Adoption > Assessment). |
| **assess-architecture** | `/pair-capability-assess-architecture` | Assess architecture pattern using resolution cascade. |
| **assess-code-quality** | `/pair-capability-assess-code-quality` | Assess code quality using quality score formula from code-metrics guidelines. |
| **assess-debt** | `/pair-capability-assess-debt` | Assess technical debt. Categorizes debt (code, design, test, documentation, infrastructure), applies prioritization formula. |
| **assess-infrastructure** | `/pair-capability-assess-infrastructure` | Assess infrastructure strategy: cloud, CI/CD, deployment choices. |
| **assess-methodology** | `/pair-capability-assess-methodology` | Assess development methodology: Scrum, Kanban, Lean, etc. |
| **assess-observability** | `/pair-capability-assess-observability` | Assess observability strategy: monitoring, logging, tracing. |
| **assess-pm** | `/pair-capability-assess-pm` | Assess project management tool choice. Delegates setup to `/pair-capability-setup-pm`. |
| **assess-stack** | `/pair-capability-assess-stack` | Assess tech stack with version tracking. Lifecycle-spanning: bootstrap (full eval), implementation (add dependency), review (detect unlisted). |
| **assess-testing** | `/pair-capability-assess-testing` | Assess testing framework and strategy. |

### Verification Capabilities

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| **verify-adoption** | `/pair-capability-verify-adoption` | Checks code against adoption files for a given scope. Detection-only: returns conformity/non-conformity list. |
| **verify-done** | `/pair-capability-verify-done` | Checks Definition of Done criteria against a PR or work item. |
| **verify-quality** | `/pair-capability-verify-quality` | Checks quality gates against the current codebase. |

### Setup and Management Capabilities

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| **setup-pm** | `/pair-capability-setup-pm` | Configures the project management tool: selection, implementation guide, adoption update. |
| **setup-gates** | `/pair-capability-setup-gates` | Configures CI/CD quality gates per quality-assurance guidelines. |
| **manage-flags** | `/pair-capability-manage-flags` | Manages feature flag lifecycle: creation, activation, deactivation, cleanup. |

### Quality Assurance Capabilities

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| **design-manual-tests** | `/pair-capability-design-manual-tests` | Designs a manual test suite by analyzing the project's artifacts, architecture, and deployment targets. Generates critical path files and a suite README. |
| **execute-manual-tests** | `/pair-capability-execute-manual-tests` | Executes a project's manual test suite against released artifacts, producing a structured report with PASS/FAIL per test case. If no suite exists, halts with guidance to run `/pair-capability-design-manual-tests` first. |

### Recording and Writing Capabilities

| Skill | Command | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| **record-decision** | `/pair-capability-record-decision` | Records an architectural (ADR) or non-architectural (ADL) decision. Updates adoption files. |
| **write-issue** | `/pair-capability-write-issue` | Creates or updates issues in the adopted PM tool using template-driven formatting. |
| **estimate** | `/pair-capability-estimate` | Estimates a refined user story using the adopted estimation methodology. |

## Skill Properties

All skills share these properties:

- **Idempotent**: Re-invocation is safe and resumes from the last incomplete step
- **Composable**: Process skills compose capability skills; capability skills can be invoked independently
- **Adoption-aware**: Skills read `.pair/adoption/` files for project-specific decisions
- **Template-driven**: Output follows templates from `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/`

## How to Use Skills

Skills are invoked as slash commands in your AI coding assistant:

```text
/pair-next                        # What should I do next?
/pair-process-implement #124      # Implement story #124
/pair-capability-verify-quality   # Run quality gates
```
