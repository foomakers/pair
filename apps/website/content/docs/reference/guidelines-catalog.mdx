title: Guidelines & How-To Catalog
description: Complete catalog of all pair Knowledge Base guidelines (9 categories) and how-to guides (11 sequential steps).
---

The pair Knowledge Base ships with opinionated guidelines organized into 9 categories and 11 sequential how-to guides covering the full AI-assisted development lifecycle. Guidelines live in `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/`, how-to guides in `.pair/knowledge/how-to/`.

## How-To Guides

11 sequential guides that walk you through the complete development process — from product requirements to code review. Each guide can be followed manually or invoked as a skill (recommended). See the [Developer Journey](/docs/developer-journey) for the full step-by-step walkthrough.

| # | Guide | Tags | Skill (preferred) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | **Create a PRD** | prd, requirements, planning | `/pair-process-specify-prd` |
| 02 | **Complete Bootstrap Checklist** | bootstrap, setup, onboarding | `/pair-process-bootstrap` |
| 03 | **Create & Prioritize Initiatives** | initiative, roadmap, P0/P1/P2 | `/pair-process-plan-initiatives` |
| 04 | **Define Subdomains** | subdomain, domain, DDD | `/pair-process-map-subdomains` |
| 05 | **Define Bounded Contexts** | bounded context, architecture, DDD | `/pair-process-map-contexts` |
| 06 | **Break Down Epics** | epic, breakdown, 2-4 sprints | `/pair-process-plan-epics` |
| 07 | **Break Down User Stories** | story, vertical slicing, INVEST | `/pair-process-plan-stories` |
| 08 | **Refine a User Story** | refine, Given-When-Then, technical analysis | `/pair-process-refine-story` |
| 09 | **Create Tasks** | task, breakdown, dependency mapping | `/pair-process-plan-tasks` |
| 10 | **Implement a Task** | implement, TDD, code | `/pair-process-implement` |
| 11 | **Code Review** | review, quality gates, ADR | `/pair-process-review` |

### How-To Flow

```text
01 PRD → 02 Bootstrap → 03 Initiatives → (04 Subdomains → 05 Contexts) → 06 Epics → 07 Stories → 08 Refine → 09 Tasks → 10 Implement → 11 Review
```

Steps 04-05 (DDD) are optional — skip them if your project doesn't need domain modeling.
