title: Team Setup
description: Install a shared Knowledge Base, customize guidelines, configure PM tool integration, and establish the team's way-of-working.
---

A walkthrough for team leads adopting pair across a development team. You'll go from a solo setup to a fully configured team environment in about 45 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Completed the [Your First Project](/docs/tutorials/first-project) tutorial (or equivalent pair experience)
- A **project repository** with Git initialized and pushed to GitHub
- **GitHub access** with permission to create Projects, labels, and issues
- A **team of 2+ developers** (or at least one teammate to onboard at the end)
- **pair-cli** installed (`pair-cli --version` should return a version)
- An **AI coding assistant** that supports Agent Skills

## What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial you'll have:

- A shared Knowledge Base installed in your team's repository
- Customized guidelines that match your team's tech stack and conventions
- PM tool integration (GitHub Projects) with boards, labels, and workflows
- A way-of-working adoption file defining your team's methodology
- At least one team member onboarded and working with the same context

## Estimated time

~45 minutes.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Install the Knowledge Base

If you haven't already, install pair in your project:

```bash
pair-cli install
```

This creates the `.pair/` directory with the default Knowledge Base, bridge files (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/copilot/`), and empty adoption templates.

### 2. Run bootstrap for your team context

Start your AI assistant and run:

```text
/pair-process-bootstrap
```

During bootstrap, make team-relevant choices:

- **Team size**: specify your actual team size
- **Methodology**: choose Scrum, Kanban, or Lean depending on your team's style
- **PM tool**: select GitHub Projects (the default) or your team's preferred tool
- **Quality gates**: define what checks run before every commit

Bootstrap records all decisions in `.pair/adoption/tech/`.

### 3. Customize the tech stack

Edit `.pair/adoption/tech/tech-stack.md` to match your team's actual technology choices. For example, if your team uses Jest instead of Vitest:

```markdown
## Testing

- jest is adopted as the testing framework (jest v29.x).
- @testing-library/react is adopted for component testing.
```

The adoption declaration pattern (`[tool] is adopted for [purpose]`) tells every AI assistant this is a decision, not a suggestion.

See [Customize for Your Team](/docs/customization/team) for the full customization guide.

### 4. Customize code design guidelines

Review `.pair/adoption/tech/` and add files for team conventions that differ from the KB defaults:

```markdown
<!-- .pair/adoption/tech/api-conventions.md -->

# API Conventions

- All REST endpoints use kebab-case paths.
- Response format follows the JSON:API specification.
- Authentication uses Bearer JWT tokens in the Authorization header.
```

The AI reads every file in `.pair/adoption/` — custom files are treated the same as overrides.

### 5. Configure the PM tool integration

If you chose GitHub Projects during bootstrap, verify the setup:

```text
/pair-capability-setup-pm
```

This skill:

1. Creates a GitHub Project board (or connects to an existing one)
2. Configures status fields (Todo → Refined → In Progress → Done)
3. Sets up labels for story types, priorities, and epics
4. Records the PM tool configuration in your way-of-working

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure your GitHub token has the `project`, `repo`, and `admin:org` scopes if you're using organization-level Projects.
</Callout>

### 6. Set quality gates

Edit `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md` to define your team's quality gate:

```markdown
## Quality Gates

- `pnpm quality-gate` is the adopted project-level quality gate command.
- Quality gate includes: type checking, testing, linting, formatting.

### Custom Gate Registry

| Order | Gate         | Command              | Required |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| 1     | Quality Gate | `pnpm quality-gate`  | Yes      |
| 2     | Security     | `pnpm audit`         | No       |
```

Every developer and every AI assistant will run these checks before committing.

### 7. Record key decisions

For significant decisions that need rationale, create Architecture Decision Records:

```text
/pair-capability-record-decision
```

This is especially important for choices your team debated — "why TypeScript over Go?", "why PostgreSQL over MongoDB?". ADRs live in `.pair/adoption/tech/adr/` and give future team members (and AI assistants) the context behind each choice.

### 8. Commit the pair setup

Stage and commit the full `.pair/` directory:

```bash
git add .pair/ AGENTS.md .claude/ .github/ .cursor/
git commit -m "chore: pair KB + team adoption files"
git push
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `.pair/` directory, bridge files, and adoption files should all be committed to version control. This ensures every team member and every AI assistant session starts with the same context.
</Callout>

### 9. Onboard a team member

Have a teammate clone the repository and open it in their AI assistant. They should:

1. **Open the project** — the bridge files are already committed, so their assistant finds `.pair/` automatically
2. **Run `/pair-next`** — pair reads the adoption files and knows the project context
3. **Start working** — the assistant uses your team's tech stack, architecture, and conventions

No manual onboarding needed. The Knowledge Base and adoption files *are* the onboarding.

### 10. Verify the team workflow

Have the onboarded teammate create a small change and go through the full cycle:

1. **Pick a story** from GitHub Projects
2. **Run `/pair-process-implement`** — the assistant creates a branch, follows TDD, runs quality gates
3. **Review the PR** — run `/pair-process-review` on the resulting pull request
4. **Merge** — confirm the squash-merge follows your commit template

If everything works end-to-end, your team setup is complete.

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warn">
  **PM tool authentication fails**: Verify your GitHub token scopes. The AI assistant needs `repo`, `project`, and possibly `admin:org` permissions. Run `gh auth status` to check.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **KB version conflicts after update**: If `pair-cli update` introduces guidelines that conflict with your adoption files, the AI will notice the inconsistency. Review the updated guidelines in `.pair/knowledge/` and adjust your adoption files if needed.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Multiple AI assistants produce different code**: Ensure all bridge files are committed. Each assistant has its own bridge (`.claude/`, `.github/copilot/`, `.cursor/`) that points to the same `.pair/` directory. If any bridge file is missing, that assistant won't find the Knowledge Base.
</Callout>

## What you've learned

- **Bootstrap** configures pair for your team's specific context in one step
- **Adoption files** override KB defaults — your customizations survive upstream updates
- **Quality gates** ensure consistent standards across every developer and AI session
- **PM tool integration** connects pair's planning skills to your issue tracker
- **Bridge files** make every AI assistant read the same context — no per-tool configuration
- **Onboarding** is automatic — commit the `.pair/` directory and teammates are ready
