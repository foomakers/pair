title: Your First Project
description: Install pair, bootstrap a project, create a PRD, generate your first initiative/epic/story, and run your first skill — all in one session.
---

A complete walkthrough for solo developers. You'll go from zero to a fully scaffolded project with AI-assisted planning in about 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** v18 or later ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **pnpm** v9+ or **npm** v9+ ([install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- **Git** initialized in your project (or a new empty directory)
- A **terminal** (macOS Terminal, iTerm2, Windows Terminal, or VS Code integrated terminal)
- An **AI coding assistant** that supports Agent Skills — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), or similar

## What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial you'll have:

- pair-cli installed globally
- A `.pair/` directory with the full Knowledge Base
- A Product Requirements Document (PRD) tailored to your idea
- Strategic initiatives prioritized by business impact
- Epics broken down from those initiatives
- User stories ready for development
- Experience running your first pair skill

## Estimated time

~30 minutes (depending on how detailed you make your PRD).

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Install pair-cli

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g @pair/pair-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
pair-cli --version
```

You should see a version number like `0.4.0`.

<Callout type="warn">
  If the command is not found, make sure pnpm's global bin directory is in your PATH. Run `pnpm bin -g` to check the location.
</Callout>

### 2. Create and initialize your project

If you don't already have a project directory:

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
```

### 3. Install the Knowledge Base

```bash
pair-cli install
```

This downloads the Knowledge Base and creates the `.pair/` directory with:

- `knowledge/` — guidelines, how-tos, templates (reference material)
- `adoption/` — empty templates for your project decisions

It also installs bridge files (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/copilot/`, `.cursor/`) so every AI assistant finds the same context.

<Callout type="info">
  The `.pair/knowledge/` directory is managed by pair-cli. Don't edit files there — your changes would be overwritten on the next update. Your decisions go in `.pair/adoption/`.
</Callout>

### 4. Start your AI assistant

Open your project in your AI coding assistant. If you're using Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

The assistant will detect the `.pair/` directory and load the Knowledge Base automatically.

### 5. Ask pair what to do next

In your assistant, run:

```text
/pair-next
```

Since this is a fresh project with no PRD and no adoption files, pair will recommend starting with the PRD.

### 6. Create your PRD

Follow pair's recommendation and run:

```text
/pair-process-specify-prd
```

The skill will guide you through a structured conversation:

1. **Project overview** — What are you building? Who is it for?
2. **Problem statement** — What problem does it solve?
3. **Success metrics** — How will you measure success?
4. **Scope** — What's in and out for the first release?
5. **Constraints** — Budget, timeline, technology, compliance?

Answer each question. pair writes the PRD to `.pair/adoption/product/adopted/PRD.md`.

<Callout type="info">
  You don't need a perfect PRD. Start with what you know — you can refine it later by re-running the skill.
</Callout>

### 7. Bootstrap the project

Now run the full bootstrap:

```text
/pair-process-bootstrap
```

Bootstrap walks you through:

- **Project categorization** — type, complexity, team size
- **Tech stack assessment** — language, framework, testing, CI/CD
- **Architecture decisions** — monolith, microservices, serverless
- **Way of working** — methodology, commit strategy, quality gates

Each decision is recorded in `.pair/adoption/tech/` as an adoption file. The AI reads these files in every future session — your decisions never drift.

### 8. Generate initiatives

With the PRD in place, break it down into strategic initiatives:

```text
/pair-process-plan-initiatives
```

pair analyzes your PRD and creates prioritized initiatives (P0 = must-have, P1 = should-have, P2 = nice-to-have). Each initiative becomes an issue in your PM tool (GitHub Projects if you configured it during bootstrap).

### 9. Break down into epics

Pick a P0 initiative and break it into epics:

```text
/pair-process-plan-epics
```

pair suggests an epic structure including "Epic 0" — the foundational setup work every project needs (repo scaffold, CI/CD, quality gates).

### 10. Create user stories

Break an epic into user stories:

```text
/pair-process-plan-stories
```

pair applies vertical slicing and INVEST validation to create stories that are independently deliverable.

### 11. Refine and start developing

You now have a complete planning hierarchy: PRD → Initiatives → Epics → Stories.

To refine a story with acceptance criteria and task breakdown:

```text
/pair-process-refine-story
```

To implement a refined story with TDD:

```text
/pair-process-implement
```

## What you've learned

- **pair-cli install** sets up the Knowledge Base and bridge files
- **`/pair-next`** always tells you what to do next based on project state
- **Process skills** follow the SDLC: PRD → Bootstrap → Initiatives → Epics → Stories → Implement → Review
- **Adoption files** in `.pair/adoption/` record your decisions and persist across sessions
- **Knowledge files** in `.pair/knowledge/` provide reference material — updated by pair-cli, never edited manually
