title: Process Lifecycle
description: The four-level, nine-step development lifecycle that pair defines — from product requirements to code review.
---

pair defines a structured development lifecycle with **four levels** and **nine steps**. Each level builds on the previous, taking a project from initial idea to production-ready code.

The lifecycle is not rigid — you enter at whatever level matches your project's current state. But every step has a specific how-to guide and a matching skill that the AI follows, ensuring consistency and completeness.

## Let /pair-next Guide You

You don't need to memorize this sequence. Run `/pair-next` at any point and pair reads your project state — open issues, story statuses, task progress — to suggest the right next step. This is the recommended way to navigate the process.

```text
/pair-next
```

**When to use it:** at the start of every session, after completing a step, when switching context, or when you're not sure what to work on next.

## The Four Levels

```text
Level 1: Induction (one-time)
  Step 1  Create PRD ─────────────── /pair-process-specify-prd
  Step 2  Bootstrap Project ──────── /pair-process-bootstrap
  Step 3  Plan Initiatives ────────── /pair-process-plan-initiatives

Level 2: Strategic Planning (per initiative)
  Step 4  Break Down Epics ────────── /pair-process-plan-epics

Level 3: Iteration (per epic)
  Step 5  Break Down Stories ──────── /pair-process-plan-stories
  Step 6  Refine Stories ──────────── /pair-process-refine-story
  Step 7  Create Tasks ────────────── /pair-process-plan-tasks

Level 4: Execution (per story)
  Step 8  Implement ───────────────── /pair-process-implement
  Step 9  Code Review ─────────────── /pair-process-review
```

You can follow this flow in two ways:

1. **Process Skills (recommended)** — invoke a slash command and the AI handles the structured process for you. See the [Skills Catalog](/docs/reference/skills-catalog) for all 32 skills.
2. **How-to Guides** — follow the manual step-by-step instructions from the Knowledge Base. See the [Guidelines & How-To Catalog](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) for all 11 guides.

Skills compose capability skills internally, enforce adoption compliance, and update your PM tool automatically. The how-to guides give you the same process with full manual control.

The detailed walkthrough for each level is in the pages that follow.

## Product Lifecycle

```text
INDUCTION
└── Product Foundation & Architecture
    │
    ├── STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
    │   └── Business Value & Market Position
    │       │
    │       ├── CUSTOMER-FACING ITERATIONS
    │       │   └── User Experience & Feature Delivery
    │       │       │
    │       │       └── CONTINUOUS VALUE DELIVERY
    │       │           └── Working Software & Feedback Loops
```

| Level | Duration | Value Stream | Card Type | Focus |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Induction | One-time | Product Foundation | PRD | Product Vision, Market Fit, Technical Architecture |
| Strategic | 6-8 sprints | Business Value | Initiative | Business Objectives, Value Proposition, Roadmap |
| Iteration | 2-4 sprints | User Experience | Epic | Feature Sets, User Journeys, Integration Points |
| Execution | 1 sprint | Working Software | Story + Task | Deliverable Features, Code Quality, User Feedback |

## Card Hierarchy

```text
Initiative (Strategic Level)
├── Epic 1 (Feature Level)
│   ├── User Story 1.1
│   │   ├── Task 1.1.1
│   │   ├── Task 1.1.2
│   │   └── Task 1.1.3
│   └── User Story 1.2
│       ├── Task 1.2.1
│       └── Task 1.2.2
└── Epic 2 (Feature Level)
    └── User Story 2.1
        └── Task 2.1.1
```

## Entry Points

You don't have to start at Step 1. Pick your entry point based on where you are:

| You're starting... | Start at | Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A brand new project | Step 1 (PRD) | `/pair-process-specify-prd` |
| Adopting pair on an existing project | Step 2 (Bootstrap) | `/pair-process-bootstrap` |
| A new initiative or roadmap cycle | Step 3 (Initiatives) | `/pair-process-plan-initiatives` |
| A sprint planning session | Step 5 (Stories) | `/pair-process-plan-stories` |
| Picking up a story to develop | Step 8 (Implement) | `/pair-process-implement` |
| Reviewing someone's PR | Step 9 (Review) | `/pair-process-review` |

Or just run `/pair-next` — it figures out where you are and what to do next.
