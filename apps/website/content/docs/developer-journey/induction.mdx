Induction happens once when starting a new project. By the end of these three steps, your project has a product vision, technical decisions, and a prioritized roadmap.

## Step 1: Create the PRD

Define what you're building, who it's for, and what success looks like.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-specify-prd` |
| **How-to guide** | [01 — How to Create a PRD](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Product idea, target audience, problem statement |
| **Output** | `.pair/adoption/product/adopted/PRD.md` |

The AI follows a 4-phase process:

1. **Template analysis** — studies the 13-section PRD template
2. **Hypothesis-driven questions** — asks structured questions about users, pain points, features, and KPIs
3. **Document generation** — produces the PRD following the template
4. **Iterative review** — submits for your review and refines based on feedback

The PRD becomes the source of truth for every subsequent step. All planning and implementation traces back to it.

## Step 2: Bootstrap the Project

Generate technical standards, configure quality gates, and set up your PM tool.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-bootstrap` |
| **How-to guide** | [02 — How to Complete Bootstrap Checklist](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | PRD (from Step 1) |
| **Output** | Adoption files in `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/` |

The AI guides you through five decision areas:

- **Project categorization** — Pet/PoC, Startup, or Enterprise (determines rigor level)
- **Architecture pattern** — monolith, microservices, serverless, etc.
- **Tech stack** — language, framework, testing, database, with version pinning
- **Infrastructure** — deployment, CI/CD, hosting
- **Way of working** — methodology (Scrum/Kanban), branching strategy, quality gates

Each decision produces an adoption file. Bootstrap composes several capability skills internally (`/pair-capability-assess-architecture`, `/pair-capability-assess-stack`, etc.) — you don't need to invoke them individually.

**For existing projects**: Start here instead of Step 1. Ask the AI assistant to analyze your codebase and produce adoption files from what it finds, rather than writing them from scratch.

## Step 3: Plan Initiatives

Extract strategic objectives from the PRD and prioritize them.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-plan-initiatives` |
| **How-to guide** | [03 — How to Create & Prioritize Initiatives](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | PRD (from Step 1) |
| **Output** | Issues in your PM tool (type: initiative) with P0/P1/P2 priority |

Initiatives are the highest-level work items — each represents a strategic objective spanning 6-8 sprints:

- **P0 (Must-Have)** — core value proposition, without these the product doesn't ship
- **P1 (Important)** — significant business value, planned for early delivery
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have)** — desirable but deferrable

The AI extracts objectives directly from your PRD sections (goals, features, success metrics) and proposes the prioritization. You validate and adjust.

Every AI session from this point forward reads these files. Decisions never drift.
