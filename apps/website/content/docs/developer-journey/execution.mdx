description: "The daily development loop — implement stories through TDD task cycles, then review and merge."
---

Execution is the daily development loop. You pick up a refined story, implement it task by task, create a PR, and get it reviewed and merged.

## Step 8: Implement

Develop a user story by working through its tasks sequentially.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-implement` |
| **How-to guide** | [10 — How to Implement a Task](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Story issue with tasks (status: Refined) |
| **Output** | Feature branch, commits, pull request |

### The Implementation Cycle

For each task, the skill follows a strict 5-step cycle:

```text
1. Context ──── Load adoption files and technical decisions
       │
2. Branch ───── Create or switch to the feature branch
       │
3. Implement ── Write code (TDD for dev tasks, direct for docs/config)
       │
4. Quality ──── Run quality gates (lint, test, type check)
       │
5. Commit ───── Commit and update task checkbox in the story
```

### TDD Discipline (Development Tasks)

The AI follows strict TDD — tests and implementation never change in the same session:

1. **RED** — write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **GREEN** — write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR** — improve structure without changing behavior

Every new module file must have a corresponding unit test file (1:1 mapping). Mocks are avoided in favor of in-memory test doubles.

### Commit Strategies

| Strategy | When | Flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Commit per task** | Multi-task stories (recommended) | Implement → confirm with dev → commit → next task |
| **Commit per story** | Single-task stories or continuous flow | Implement all → confirm with dev → commit all |

With commit-per-task, the developer gets a checkpoint between every task — the AI presents a summary and waits for confirmation before committing.

### PR Creation

After all tasks are complete, the skill:
1. Pushes the feature branch
2. Creates a PR following the team's [PR template](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog)
3. Links the PR to the story issue
4. Marks the PR as ready for review

## Step 9: Code Review

Review a pull request through a structured 6-phase process.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-review` |
| **How-to guide** | [11 — How to Code Review](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Pull request |
| **Output** | Review decision: approve, request changes, or reject |

### The Review Phases

```text
Phase 1 ── Validation ────── PR structure, linked story, template compliance
       │
Phase 2 ── Technical ─────── Code quality, architecture match, security
       │
Phase 3 ── Adoption ──────── Libraries match tech-stack.md, patterns match architecture.md
       │
Phase 4 ── Completeness ──── All AC covered, all tasks done, DoD met
       │
Phase 5 ── Decision ──────── APPROVED, CHANGES REQUESTED, or REJECT
       │
Phase 6 ── Merge ─────────── Merge PR, update story/epic/initiative status
```

### ADR Enforcement

If the review detects a new library not listed in `tech-stack.md` or an architecture pattern not recorded in `architecture.md`, it **blocks** and requests an Architecture Decision Record before approval. This ensures every technical choice is deliberate and documented.

### Parent Cascade

After merge, the skill updates the status hierarchy:
- Story → **Done**
- If all stories in the epic are Done → Epic → **Done**
- If all epics in the initiative are Done → Initiative → **Done**

## The Complete Loop

```text
/pair-next → suggests story to implement
    │
/pair-process-implement #story-id
    │
    ├── Task 1: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → commit
    ├── Task 2: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → commit
    └── Task N: ... → commit → PR created
    │
/pair-process-review #pr-number
    │
    ├── Approved → merge → status cascade
    └── Changes requested → fix → re-review
    │
/pair-next → suggests next story
```

This loop repeats for every story. `/pair-next` always knows what comes next.
