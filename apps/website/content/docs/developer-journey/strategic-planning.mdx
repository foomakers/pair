title: "Strategic Planning: Epics"
description: "Break initiatives into delivery-sized epics — the bridge between strategy and sprint work."

Strategic planning happens once per initiative. You take a high-level objective and decompose it into epics that can be delivered in 2-4 sprints each.

## Step 4: Break Down Epics

Decompose an initiative into manageable delivery chunks.

| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-plan-epics` |
| **How-to guide** | [06 — How to Break Down Epics](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Initiative issue from your PM tool |
| **Output** | Issues in your PM tool (type: epic) linked to the parent initiative |

The AI analyzes the initiative scope and proposes epics sized for 2-4 sprints. Each epic is:

- **Self-contained** — delivers a coherent set of features
- **Independently releasable** — can go to production without waiting for other epics
- **Sized for a team** — enough work for 2-4 sprints, not more

### Epic 0: Foundation Work

For new projects, the skill includes an **Epic 0 assessment** — infrastructure, tooling, and foundation work that must happen before feature development:

- Repository setup, CI/CD pipeline
- Core libraries and shared components
- Development environment and quality gates
- Authentication/authorization foundation (if needed)

Epic 0 is created only when the assessment identifies essential setup work.

## Optional: Domain Modeling (DDD)

If your project benefits from domain-driven design, add two intermediate steps between initiatives and epics:

### Define Subdomains

| **Skill** | `/pair-process-map-subdomains` |
| **How-to guide** | [04 — How to Define Subdomains](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |

Classifies problem areas as:
- **Core** — your competitive advantage, build in-house
- **Supporting** — necessary but not differentiating, build or buy
- **Generic** — commodity, buy or use open source

### Define Bounded Contexts

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill** | `/pair-process-map-contexts` |
| **How-to guide** | [05 — How to Define Bounded Contexts](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |

Establishes service boundaries and integration patterns between contexts (synchronous, asynchronous, shared kernel).

Skip DDD if your project is a simple CRUD app or doesn't need service decomposition.

## What You Have After Strategic Planning

```text
PM Tool:
├── Initiative (P0): User Management
│   ├── Epic 0: Foundation & Infrastructure
│   ├── Epic 1: Authentication & Registration
│   ├── Epic 2: Profile & Preferences
│   └── Epic 3: Admin Dashboard
└── Initiative (P1): ...
    ├── Epic 4: ...
    └── Epic 5: ...
```

Each epic is ready for iteration — the next level breaks them into sprint-sized stories.
