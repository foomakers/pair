description: "Prepare work for development sprints — break epics into stories, refine acceptance criteria, and create implementation tasks."

Iteration happens per epic. You take a feature-level epic and break it into sprint-ready work items: user stories with acceptance criteria and implementation tasks.

## Step 5: Break Down User Stories

Slice an epic into vertical user stories that each deliver end-to-end value.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-plan-stories` |
| **How-to guide** | [07 — How to Break Down User Stories](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Epic issue from your PM tool |
| **Output** | Issues in your PM tool (type: story) validated against INVEST criteria |

The AI applies **vertical slicing** — each story delivers a thin slice of functionality from UI to database, rather than a horizontal layer. Stories are validated against the INVEST framework:

- **I**ndependent — can be developed without waiting for other stories
- **N**egotiable — details are open for discussion
- **V**aluable — delivers something useful to the user
- **E**stimable — small enough to estimate confidently
- **S**mall — fits in a single sprint
- **T**estable — has clear pass/fail criteria

## Step 6: Refine a User Story

Transform a rough story into a development-ready specification.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-refine-story` |
| **How-to guide** | [08 — How to Refine a User Story](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Story issue (status: Todo) |
| **Output** | Story updated with acceptance criteria, technical analysis, and sizing (status: Refined) |

Refinement adds three things to a story:

### Acceptance Criteria (Given-When-Then)

```text
Given the user is on the login page
When they enter valid credentials and click "Sign in"
Then they are redirected to the dashboard
And their session is active for 24 hours
```

Every AC is testable — either it passes or it doesn't.

### Technical Analysis

- Implementation approach (files to create/modify)
- Integration points (APIs, services, databases)
- Technical risks and mitigations
- Dependencies on other stories or external systems

### Story Sizing

Story points using the team's estimation methodology. The AI proposes a size based on complexity and the team validates.

## Step 7: Create Tasks

Break a refined story into concrete implementation tasks.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill (recommended)** | `/pair-process-plan-tasks` |
| **How-to guide** | [09 — How to Create Tasks](/docs/reference/guidelines-catalog) |
| **Input** | Refined story issue |
| **Output** | Task Breakdown section appended to the story body |

Tasks are documented **inline in the story body** — not as separate issues. Each task includes:

- Implementation approach and files to touch
- Acceptance criteria mapped to the parent story's AC
- Dependency graph showing task ordering
- TDD approach (for development tasks)

### Task Types

| Type | Approach | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development | TDD: write test → implement → refactor | "Implement login API endpoint" |
| Documentation | Direct implementation | "Write API documentation" |
| Configuration | Follow infrastructure guidelines | "Configure CI pipeline" |

### AC Coverage Table

Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one task:

```text
| AC   | Tasks   |
| AC-1 | T-1     |
| AC-2 | T-2     |
| AC-3 | T-2, T-3|
```

No orphan ACs, no orphan tasks.

## What You Have After Iteration

```text
PM Tool:
├── Epic 1: Authentication & Registration
│   ├── Story: User can register with email (Refined, 3 pts)
│   │   ├── T-1: Registration API endpoint
│   │   ├── T-2: Registration form UI
│   │   ├── T-3: Email verification flow
│   │   └── T-4: E2E tests
│   ├── Story: User can log in (Refined, 2 pts)
│   │   ├── T-1: Login API endpoint
│   │   ├── T-2: Login form UI
│   │   └── T-3: Session management
│   └── Story: User can reset password (Refined, 3 pts)
│       └── ...
```

Every story is development-ready: clear AC, technical approach, sized, with tasks.
