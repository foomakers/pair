title: Windsurf
description: Set up pair with Windsurf — configure .windsurf/rules, discover skills, and follow the bridge pattern.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) (by Codeium) installed
- A pair-enabled project (`pair-cli init` completed, `.pair/` directory exists)
- Node.js 18+

## Configure Agent File

Windsurf reads project-level rules from `.windsurf/rules/` at the repository root. pair generates these bridge files during `pair-cli init`.

### .windsurf/rules/

pair creates rule files in `.windsurf/rules/` that point Windsurf to your `.pair/` directory:

```text
your-project/
├── .windsurf/
│   ├── rules/             ← Windsurf reads these automatically
│   └── skills/            ← symlinks to .claude/skills/
├── .pair/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   └── adoption/
└── ...
```

The rules file contains the same project context as `AGENTS.md` — task selection, essential commands, key references, and quick rules — formatted for Windsurf's conventions.

### The Bridge Pattern

`.windsurf/rules/` points to `.pair/` — the single source of truth:

```text
.windsurf/rules/  ──→ .pair/knowledge/   (guidelines)
                  ──→ .pair/adoption/    (your decisions)
```

## Use Skills

Skills are available in `.windsurf/skills/` as symlinks to the canonical copies in `.claude/skills/`. Reference a skill by asking Windsurf to follow it:

```text
Follow the instructions in .windsurf/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md to implement story #42
```

### Common Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pair-next` | Determine next action based on project state |
| `pair-process-implement` | Implement a story task by task |
| `pair-process-review` | Structured code review |
| `pair-process-refine-story` | Refine a story with acceptance criteria |

## Workflow Tips

### Cascade and Flows

Windsurf's Cascade feature works well with pair's structured process. When following a skill like `/pair-process-implement`, Cascade can execute multi-step workflows autonomously while respecting your adoption files.

### Multi-Agent Teams

If your team uses Windsurf alongside other AI tools, the bridge pattern ensures consistency. `.windsurf/rules/` and `.claude/skills/` both point to the same `.pair/` source of truth.

### Skills as Symlinks

Skills in `.windsurf/skills/` are symlinks to `.claude/skills/`. `pair-cli update` refreshes all tool directories simultaneously. On Windows, pair falls back to full copies.

## Verify It Works

Open Windsurf in your pair-enabled project and ask:

```text
Read the pair rules in .windsurf/rules/ and tell me what project I'm working on
```

**Expected output**: Windsurf reads the rules, follows the references to `.pair/adoption/`, and describes your project context. If it can't find the rules, check that `pair-cli init` completed successfully.
