title: Cursor
description: Set up pair with Cursor — configure .cursor/rules, discover skills, and follow the bridge pattern.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor](https://cursor.com) installed
- A pair-enabled project (`pair-cli init` completed, `.pair/` directory exists)
- Node.js 18+

## Configure Agent File

Cursor reads project-level rules from `.cursor/rules/` at the repository root. pair generates these bridge files during `pair-cli init`.

### .cursor/rules/

pair creates rule files in `.cursor/rules/` that point Cursor to your `.pair/` directory:

```text
your-project/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── rules/             ← Cursor reads these automatically
│   └── skills/            ← symlinks to .claude/skills/
├── .pair/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   └── adoption/
└── ...
```

The rules file contains the same information as `AGENTS.md` — task selection, essential commands, key references, and quick rules — formatted for Cursor's conventions.

### The Bridge Pattern

`.cursor/rules/` points to `.pair/` — the single source of truth. When you update adoption files or install new skills, Cursor picks up the changes at the next session start.

```text
.cursor/rules/  ──→ .pair/knowledge/   (guidelines)
                ──→ .pair/adoption/    (your decisions)
```

## Use Skills

Skills are available in `.cursor/skills/` as symlinks to the canonical copies in `.claude/skills/`. Cursor discovers these files and can follow the structured instructions when you reference them.

To invoke a skill, ask Cursor to follow the skill instructions:

```text
Follow the instructions in .cursor/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md to implement story #42
```

### Common Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pair-next` | Determine next action based on project state |
| `pair-process-implement` | Implement a story task by task |
| `pair-process-review` | Structured code review |
| `pair-process-refine-story` | Refine a story with acceptance criteria |

## Workflow Tips

### Cursor Rules and Adoption Files

Cursor rules provide the entry point, but the real context lives in `.pair/adoption/`. When Cursor reads the rules, it discovers your architecture decisions, tech stack, and development process — keeping responses aligned with your project.

### Multi-Agent Teams

If your team uses both Cursor and Claude Code (or other tools), the bridge pattern ensures everyone follows the same standards. The `.pair/` directory is the single source of truth; `.cursor/rules/` is just one entry point.

### Skills as Symlinks

Skills in `.cursor/skills/` are symlinks to `.claude/skills/`. This means `pair-cli update` updates all tools simultaneously — no manual sync needed. On Windows, pair falls back to full copies if symlinks aren't available.

## Verify It Works

Open Cursor in your pair-enabled project and ask:

```text
Read the pair rules in .cursor/rules/ and tell me what project I'm working on
```

**Expected output**: Cursor reads the rules, follows the references to `.pair/adoption/`, and describes your project context (tech stack, architecture, current work items). If it can't find the rules, check that `pair-cli init` completed successfully.
