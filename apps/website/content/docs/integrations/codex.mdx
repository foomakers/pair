description: Set up pair with OpenAI Codex — configure AGENTS.md, discover skills, and follow the bridge pattern.
---

## Prerequisites

- [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated
- A pair-enabled project (`pair-cli init` completed, `.pair/` directory exists)
- Node.js 18+

## Configure Agent File

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` at the repository root — the same universal bridge file used by Claude Code. pair generates it during `pair-cli init`.

### AGENTS.md

Codex automatically discovers and reads `AGENTS.md` when entering a repository. The file contains:

- Task selection algorithm (which how-to guide to follow)
- Essential commands (`pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`)
- Key references to adoption files and guidelines
- Quick rules (testing, commits, adoption checks)

```text
your-project/
├── AGENTS.md              ← Codex reads this automatically
├── .agents/
│   └── skills/            ← skill symlinks (→ .claude/skills/)
├── .pair/
│   ├── knowledge/         ← upstream guidelines (don't edit)
│   └── adoption/          ← your project decisions
└── ...
```

No additional configuration needed — Codex and Claude Code share the same entry point. Skills are distributed to `.agents/skills/` as symlinks pointing to the canonical `.claude/skills/` directory.

### The Bridge Pattern

`AGENTS.md` points to `.pair/` — the single source of truth:

```text
AGENTS.md ──→ .pair/knowledge/   (guidelines)
          ──→ .pair/adoption/    (your decisions)
```

## Use Skills

Skills are invoked as slash commands in Codex, the same way as in Claude Code:

```bash
/pair-next                    # what should I work on?
/pair-process-implement #42   # implement story #42
/pair-process-review          # review current PR
```

Codex discovers skills in `.agents/skills/` (symlinked to the canonical `.claude/skills/`). Since Codex supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, it can read and execute pair's SKILL.md files directly.

### Common Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/pair-next` | Determine next action based on project state |
| `/pair-process-implement` | Implement a story task by task |
| `/pair-process-review` | Structured code review |
| `/pair-process-refine-story` | Refine a story with acceptance criteria |

## Workflow Tips

### Sandboxed Execution

Codex runs in a sandboxed environment by default. pair's skills work within these constraints — they read files, make code changes, and create commits through standard Git operations. No special permissions needed beyond filesystem and Git access.

### Shared Entry Point with Claude Code

Since both Codex and Claude Code read `AGENTS.md`, teams can switch between tools without any configuration changes. The project context, adoption files, and skills remain identical.

### Multi-Agent Teams

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` while Cursor reads `.cursor/rules/` and Copilot reads `.github/agents/` — all pointing to the same `.pair/` directory. The AI tool is an implementation detail; the standards are consistent.

## Verify It Works

Open Codex in your pair-enabled project and run:

```bash
/pair-next
```

**Expected output**: Codex reads `AGENTS.md`, follows the references to your adoption files, and suggests the next action. If it can't find `AGENTS.md`, check that `pair-cli init` completed successfully.
