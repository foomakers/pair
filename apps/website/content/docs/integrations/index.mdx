title: AI Coding Tools
description: Set up pair to work with your AI coding assistant — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, or Codex.
---

pair works with any AI coding assistant that can read project files. Each tool has its own configuration format, but they all connect to the same source of truth: your `.pair/` directory.

## The Bridge Pattern

pair installs **bridge files** that let each AI tool discover your Knowledge Base and adoption files in its native way:

```text
AGENTS.md              → Claude Code, Codex, and any AGENTS.md-compatible tool
CLAUDE.md              → Claude Code
.github/agents/        → GitHub Copilot
.cursor/rules/         → Cursor
.windsurf/rules/       → Windsurf
.agents/skills/        → Codex
.agent/skills/         → generic Agent Skills discovery path
```

All bridge files point to `.pair/`. One source of truth, multiple entry points. When you update your adoption files or install new skills, every AI tool picks up the changes automatically.

## Agent Skills Open Standard

pair skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard — not a proprietary format. Any AI tool that supports Agent Skills can discover and invoke pair's process and capability skills. This means you're not locked into a single assistant: your team can use different tools while following the same standards.

### Coexistence with Other Skills

pair skills coexist with custom skills or skills from other tools. The `prefix` in `config.json` (default: `"pair"`) namespaces all installed skills — e.g., `pair-process-implement`, `pair-capability-verify-quality`. Your own skills or skills from other sources use different prefixes (or no prefix), so there are no naming clashes:

```text
.claude/skills/
├── pair-process-implement/       ← pair skill (prefix: "pair")
├── pair-capability-verify-quality/
├── acme-deploy-staging/          ← another tool (prefix: "acme")
└── my-custom-skill/              ← your own skill (no prefix)
```

## Supported Tools

| Tool | Bridge File | Skill Invocation |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| [Claude Code](/docs/integrations/claude-code) | `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` | `/skill-name` slash commands |
| [Codex](/docs/integrations/codex) | `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/` | `/skill-name` slash commands |
| [Cursor](/docs/integrations/cursor) | `.cursor/rules/` | Skill file discovery |
| [GitHub Copilot](/docs/integrations/github-copilot) | `.github/agents/` | Agent mode |
| [Windsurf](/docs/integrations/windsurf) | `.windsurf/rules/` | Skill file discovery |

Pick your tool and follow the setup guide. The process takes a few minutes.

### Other AGENTS.md-Compatible Tools

`AGENTS.md` is a convention adopted by a growing number of AI tools. Any tool that reads `AGENTS.md` at the repository root works with pair out of the box — no dedicated bridge needed. pair also distributes skills to `.agent/skills/` as a generic discovery path. If your tool supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and reads from this location, it will find pair's skills automatically.

## Skill Distribution & config.json

pair distributes skills to **all AI tools simultaneously** from a single source. The distribution is controlled by `config.json` in the KB:

### How It Works

```text
KB source (.skills/)
    ↓ flatten + prefix transforms
.claude/skills/              (canonical — physical copies)
    ↓ symlinks
.github/skills/              → .claude/skills/
.cursor/skills/              → .claude/skills/
.windsurf/skills/            → .claude/skills/
.agent/skills/               → .claude/skills/
.agents/skills/              → .claude/skills/
```

1. **Canonical target** (`.claude/skills/`) receives physical copies of all skills
2. **Secondary targets** receive relative symlinks pointing to the canonical copy
3. On Windows, symlinks fall back to full copies automatically

### Distribution Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Used For |
|------|----------|----------|
| `canonical` | Physical copy, source of truth | `.claude/skills/` |
| `symlink` | Relative symlink to canonical | `.github/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc. |
| `copy` | Independent copy with optional transforms | `CLAUDE.md` (transformed from `AGENTS.md`) |

### Transform Pipeline

Skills in the KB use a category structure. pair transforms them during installation:

```text
Source:      .skills/process/implement/SKILL.md
Flatten:     process/implement → process-implement
Prefix:      process-implement → pair-process-implement
Installed:   .claude/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md
Symlinked:   .github/skills/pair-process-implement/ → .claude/...
```

The transform also rewrites internal references — skill-to-skill links and slash command names are updated to match the flattened/prefixed names.

### Customizing Distribution

The `config.json` `skills` registry controls everything:

```json
"skills": {
  "source": ".skills",
  "flatten": true,
  "prefix": "pair",
  "targets": [
    { "path": ".claude/skills/", "mode": "canonical" },
    { "path": ".github/skills/", "mode": "symlink" },
    { "path": ".cursor/skills/", "mode": "symlink" },
    { "path": ".windsurf/skills/", "mode": "symlink" }
  ]
}
```

By default, pair distributes skills to all major AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Codex). To support only specific tools in your project, add or remove targets from the `skills.targets` array. The same applies to the `agents` registry for bridge files. This keeps your repository clean — only the tool directories your team actually uses.
