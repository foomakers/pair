description: Set up pair with GitHub Copilot — configure .github/agents, copilot-instructions.md, and follow the bridge pattern.
---

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) with agent mode enabled
- VS Code or compatible editor with Copilot extension
- A pair-enabled project (`pair-cli init` completed, `.pair/` directory exists)
- Node.js 18+

## Configure Agent File

GitHub Copilot in agent mode reads project instructions from `.github/` at the repository root. pair generates these bridge files during `pair-cli init`.

### .github/agents/

pair creates role-specific agent files that define different working modes:

```text
your-project/
├── .github/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── product-manager.agent.md    ← planning & strategy
│   │   ├── staff-engineer.agent.md     ← architecture & review
│   │   └── product-engineer.agent.md   ← implementation & tasks
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md         ← general Copilot context
│   └── skills/                         ← symlinks to .claude/skills/
├── .pair/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   └── adoption/
└── ...
```

Each agent file includes:
- A YAML header with `description` and `tools` access list
- Core responsibilities mapped to specific how-to guides
- Skills that the agent can invoke
- Success criteria for the role

### copilot-instructions.md

General project instructions that Copilot reads for all interactions. Contains the same quick-start context as `AGENTS.md` — essential commands, key references, and coding conventions.

### The Bridge Pattern

`.github/agents/` and `copilot-instructions.md` point to `.pair/` — the single source of truth:

```text
.github/agents/          ──→ .pair/knowledge/how-to/  (process guides)
copilot-instructions.md  ──→ .pair/adoption/          (your decisions)
                         ──→ .pair/knowledge/         (guidelines)
```

## Use Skills

Skills are available in `.github/skills/` as symlinks to the canonical copies in `.claude/skills/`. In agent mode, reference a skill by pointing Copilot to the SKILL.md file:

```text
@workspace Follow .github/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md to implement story #42
```

### Agent Modes

The three agent files provide different working contexts:

| Agent | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `product-manager` | Planning initiatives, creating stories, refining requirements |
| `staff-engineer` | Architecture decisions, code review, project setup |
| `product-engineer` | Implementing tasks, writing code, creating PRs |

### Common Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pair-next` | Determine next action based on project state |
| `pair-process-implement` | Implement a story task by task |
| `pair-process-review` | Structured code review |
| `pair-process-refine-story` | Refine a story with acceptance criteria |

## Workflow Tips

### Choosing the Right Agent

Start with `product-engineer` for most development work. Switch to `product-manager` when planning or refining stories, and `staff-engineer` for architecture decisions or code review.

### Multi-Agent Teams

The `.github/agents/` structure is already in your repository. Team members using Copilot get role-specific context automatically. Members using other AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor) get equivalent context through their own bridge files.

### Skills as Symlinks

Skills in `.github/skills/` are symlinks to `.claude/skills/`, keeping all tools in sync. `pair-cli update` refreshes everything at once.

## Verify It Works

Open VS Code with Copilot agent mode in your pair-enabled project. Select the `product-engineer` agent and ask:

```text
Read the pair adoption files and tell me what project I'm working on
```

**Expected output**: Copilot reads `.github/agents/product-engineer.agent.md`, follows the references to `.pair/adoption/`, and describes your project context. If it doesn't find the agent files, check that `pair-cli init` completed successfully.
