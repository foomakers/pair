title: Solo Setup
description: Configure pair for solo development — minimal setup, no team coordination needed.
---

Working alone? After completing the [general quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart), you're mostly done. This page covers solo-specific details.

## What You Get

When you start a conversation with your AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor), it reads the `.pair/` folder and understands:

- **How to work** — process guides define every step from idea to merge
- **What standards to follow** — guidelines cover architecture, testing, code design, security
- **What you've decided** — adoption files record your tech stack, architecture, and way of working

The AI generates consistent, standards-aligned code across every session — no need to re-explain your project context.

## Solo Workflow

As a solo developer, the full process lifecycle is available but lightweight:

1. **Start each session** with `/pair-next` — the AI determines what to work on
2. **Skip team ceremonies** — no sprint planning or standups needed, just follow the how-to guides
3. **Use skills directly** — run `/pair-process-implement` to start coding a story, `/pair-process-review` to self-review your PR
4. **Adoption files are yours** — change decisions anytime by updating files in `.pair/adoption/`

## Explore Available Assets

See what pair installed:

```bash
pair-cli install --list-targets
