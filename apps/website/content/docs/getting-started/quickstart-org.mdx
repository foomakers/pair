description: Roll out pair across multiple teams with custom KB packaging, distribution, and organization-wide standards.

Deploy pair across your organization. By the end of this guide, you will have a custom Knowledge Base package that can be distributed to every team, ensuring consistent AI-assisted development practices organization-wide.

Before starting, complete the [general quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) — install pair-cli and the Knowledge Base.

## Set Up the Central Knowledge Base

Start with the default pair Knowledge Base in your central repository, then customize it:

### Organization-Specific Guidelines

Add or modify files in `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/` to reflect your organization's standards:

- **Code design** — naming conventions, design patterns, review criteria
- **Testing strategy** — coverage targets, testing frameworks, test categories
- **Security** — authentication patterns, data handling, compliance requirements
- **Architecture** — approved patterns, integration standards, API conventions

### Standard Adoption Templates

Pre-fill `.pair/adoption/` with organization-wide defaults:

- **Tech stack** — approved languages, frameworks, and libraries
- **Infrastructure** — approved cloud providers, CI/CD pipelines
- **Way of working** — branching strategy, review process, quality gates

Teams can extend these defaults with project-specific decisions. The `adoption` registry uses **add** behavior — it never overwrites existing decisions, so team customizations are preserved.

## Package Your Custom KB

Once your KB is ready, package it for distribution:

```bash
pair-cli package
```

This creates a distributable ZIP with a `manifest.json` containing version, checksums, and a file list. The package includes everything in `.pair/` — your customized guidelines, templates, and adoption defaults.

## Distribute via GitHub Releases

Publish the package as a GitHub Release artifact:

1. Tag a release in your central KB repository
2. Attach the ZIP artifact from `pair-cli package`
3. CI can automate this with SHA256 checksum generation

Teams install your custom KB by pointing pair-cli to your release:

```bash
pair-cli install --source https://github.com/your-org/your-kb/releases/latest/download/kb.zip
```

## Team Onboarding

When a team adopts pair with your organization's KB:

1. **Install** — `pair-cli install --source <your-kb-url>` downloads and installs the custom KB
2. **Customize** — the team adds project-specific adoption decisions (tech stack, architecture)
3. **Develop** — every AI assistant reads the combined KB (org standards + team decisions)
4. **Update** — `pair-cli update` refreshes the KB when the organization publishes a new version

### Version Coordination

CLI version maps to KB version. When you release a new KB version:

- Teams run `pair-cli update` to get the latest guidelines
- Organization standards propagate automatically
- Team-specific adoption files are preserved (never overwritten)

## Asset Registries

The CLI uses five asset registries with specific behaviors:

| Registry | Behavior | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `knowledge` | mirror | Syncs KB content (overwrites stale files) |
| `adoption` | add | Only adds new files (preserves team decisions) |
| `github` | mirror | GitHub workflows and configuration |
| `agents` | mirror | AI agent bridge files (AGENTS.md) |
| `skills` | mirror | Agent skills distributed to AI tool directories |

The distinction between **mirror** (sync everything) and **add** (preserve existing) is key: organization guidelines update automatically, but team decisions are never overwritten.

## Compliance and Governance

With a centralized KB, your organization gets:

- **Consistent standards** — every team follows the same guidelines
- **Auditable decisions** — adoption files and ADRs document every architectural choice
- **Controlled updates** — KB versioning ensures teams use approved standards
- **Flexible customization** — teams extend (never conflict with) organization defaults
