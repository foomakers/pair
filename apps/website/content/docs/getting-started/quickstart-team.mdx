description: Configure pair for a development team with shared standards, adoption files, and multi-agent support.
---

Set up pair for your development team. By the end of this guide, every team member's AI assistant will follow the same standards, make consistent decisions, and understand your team's architecture.

Before starting, complete the [general quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) — install pair-cli and the Knowledge Base.

## Configure Team Standards

After installation, the `.pair/adoption/` folder contains empty templates. Fill these in collaboratively to record your team's decisions:

### Architecture

Edit `.pair/adoption/tech/architecture.md` to document:

- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, modular monolith)
- API style (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Data storage choices

### Tech Stack

Edit `.pair/adoption/tech/tech-stack.md` to list:

- Language and framework versions
- Testing framework and coverage targets
- Linting and formatting tools
- Package manager

### Way of Working

Edit `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md` to define:

- Development methodology (Kanban, Scrum)
- Branching strategy
- Code review process
- Quality gate commands

## The Agent Bridge Pattern

pair installs bridge files that connect AI assistants to your Knowledge Base:

```text
AGENTS.md              # Universal entry point (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
.github/copilot/       # GitHub Copilot-specific instructions
.cursor/               # Cursor-specific rules
```

All bridge files point to `.pair/` — there is one source of truth. When a team member opens their AI assistant, it reads the bridge file for their tool, which directs it to the Knowledge Base.

This means every AI assistant on the team follows the same standards, regardless of which tool each developer uses.

## Share Adoption Decisions

Once your team records decisions in `.pair/adoption/`, commit them to the repository:

```bash
git add .pair/adoption/
git commit -m "chore: record team adoption decisions"
git push
```

Every team member who pulls the latest changes gets the updated decisions. Their AI assistant reads the new adoption files and immediately adjusts its behavior.

## How It Works Day-to-Day

1. **Developer starts a session** — the AI reads `.pair/` and understands the project context
2. **Developer asks for code** — the AI follows the adopted tech stack, architecture, and standards
3. **Code review** — the AI checks code against adoption files and guidelines
4. **Decisions change** — the team updates adoption files, commits, and every AI adapts

The Knowledge Base provides consistency: no more explaining your architecture from scratch, no more AI-generated code using unapproved libraries, no more drifting decisions.
