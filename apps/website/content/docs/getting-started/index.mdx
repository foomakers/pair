title: What is pair?
description: An overview of pair — the AI-assisted development toolkit that provides structured context for your AI coding assistant.

**Code is the easy part.** The hard part is getting your AI assistant to understand your project's architecture, standards, and decisions — and keep that understanding consistent across every session.

pair solves this with three core components:

## Knowledge Base

A structured set of documents — guidelines, how-tos, architecture decisions, templates — that gets installed into your project's `.pair/` folder. Think of it as onboarding documentation for your AI teammate: instead of explaining everything from scratch every session, you give it a comprehensive manual.

## Skills

Structured instructions that AI assistants discover and execute, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills automate the full product lifecycle — from PRD creation to code review — with 30 composable skills covering process and capability concerns.

## Adoption Files

Your project-specific decisions: which tech stack, architecture pattern, and way of working you chose. Every time the AI generates code, it reads these files and stays aligned with your choices. Decisions never drift.
