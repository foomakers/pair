title: What is pair?
description: An overview of pair — the AI-assisted development toolkit that provides structured context for your AI coding assistant.

**Code is the easy part.** The hard part is getting your AI assistant to understand your project's architecture, standards, and decisions — and keep that understanding consistent across every session.

pair solves this with three core components:

## Knowledge Base

A structured set of documents — guidelines, how-tos, architecture decisions, templates — that gets installed into your project's `.pair/` folder. Think of it as onboarding documentation for your AI teammate: instead of explaining everything from scratch every session, you give it a comprehensive manual.

## Skills

Structured instructions that AI assistants discover and execute, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills automate the full product lifecycle — from PRD creation to code review — with 30 composable skills covering process and capability concerns.

## Adoption Files

Your project-specific decisions: which tech stack, architecture pattern, and way of working you chose. Every time the AI generates code, it reads these files and stays aligned with your choices. Decisions never drift.

You don't write these files manually. Run `/pair-next` and the AI walks you through the full process — from PRD to architecture to tech stack — generating each adoption file along the way. Applying pair to an existing project? Ask your AI assistant to analyze the codebase and produce the adoption files from what it finds.

## Choose your path

- **[Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)** — Install pair-cli, set up the Knowledge Base, and start using it.
- **[Solo Setup](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-solo)** — Working alone? Minimal configuration, no team coordination.
- **[Team Setup](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-team)** — Shared standards and the agent bridge pattern for multi-developer teams.
- **[Organization Rollout](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-org)** — Custom KB packaging, distribution, and governance across multiple teams.

## Go deeper with tutorials

Once you're set up, pick a [tutorial](/docs/tutorials) that matches your context for a guided, end-to-end walkthrough (30–60 min):

- **[Your First Project](/docs/tutorials/first-project)** — Solo developer · ~30 min
- **[Team Setup](/docs/tutorials/team-setup)** — Team lead · ~45 min
- **[Enterprise Adoption](/docs/tutorials/enterprise-adoption)** — Enterprise architect · ~60 min
