description: Install pair-cli, set up the Knowledge Base, and start using AI-assisted development — for new and existing projects.
---

Get up and running with pair on macOS or Linux. By the end of this guide, your project will have a Knowledge Base that gives your AI assistant full context about your development standards.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (or npm) package manager
- Terminal access

## Install pair-cli

### Option 1: Package Manager (Recommended)

Install pair-cli globally:

```bash
npm install -g @pair/pair-cli
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @pair/pair-cli
```

### Option 2: Manual Install (Offline)

For air-gapped environments:

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/foomakers/pair/releases)
2. Extract the `pair-cli-manual-vX.Y.Z.zip` file
3. Run directly from the extracted folder

### Verify Installation

```bash
pair-cli --version
```

Expected output:

```text
pair-cli vX.Y.Z
```

## Install the Knowledge Base

Navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
pair-cli install
```

This creates the `.pair/` folder with documentation, guidelines, how-to guides, and adoption templates. It also sets up `.github/` workflows and the agent bridge pattern (`AGENTS.md`).

Your project now has:

```text
.pair/
  knowledge/          # Reference material: process guides, standards
    how-to/           # 11 step-by-step guides (PRD → code review)
    guidelines/       # Technical standards (architecture, testing, code design)
    assets/           # Templates (PRD, checklist, commit, PR)
  adoption/           # Your decisions (filled in as you make them)
    product/          # PRD, subdomain definitions
    tech/             # Architecture, tech stack, infrastructure
```

See what pair can install in your project:

```bash
pair-cli install --list-targets
```

## Start Using pair

Your AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor) now reads the `.pair/` folder automatically. The next step is creating your **adoption files** — the project-specific decisions that keep every AI session aligned.

You don't write these files manually. The AI generates them interactively, asking the right questions along the way.

### New Project

Run `/pair-next` in your AI assistant. It detects empty adoption files and walks you through:

1. **PRD creation** — the AI asks about your product vision, users, pain points, and features, then generates `.pair/adoption/product/adopted/PRD.md`
2. **Bootstrap** — the AI guides you through architecture, tech stack, infrastructure, and way-of-working decisions, generating adoption files in `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/`
3. **What comes next** — `/pair-next` continues to suggest the right next step as your project evolves

### Existing Project

For projects with an existing codebase, paste this prompt into your AI assistant:

```text
Analyze this project's codebase and create the pair adoption files interactively.

Read the project structure, dependencies, configuration, and conventions. Then:

1. **PRD** — Ask me about the product vision, users, pain points, and features.
   Generate `.pair/adoption/product/adopted/PRD.md` following the PRD template
   in `.pair/knowledge/assets/PRD_template.md`.

2. **Architecture** — Propose the architecture pattern based on what you find
   (monolith, microservices, etc.) and ask me to confirm or adjust.
   Generate `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/architecture.md`.

3. **Tech Stack** — List detected languages, frameworks, and libraries with
   versions. Ask me if anything is missing or should change.
   Generate `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/tech-stack.md`.

4. **Way of Working** — Detect branching strategy, CI/CD, methodology from
   config files. Ask me to confirm or adjust.
   Generate `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/way-of-working.md`.

After generating all files, suggest I run `/pair-next` to continue.
```

The AI reads your code, proposes decisions based on what it finds, and asks you to confirm or adjust. Once done, run `/pair-next` to continue with the structured development process.

## Keep Your KB Up to Date

When pair publishes new guidelines, templates, or how-to improvements:

```bash
pair-cli update
```

This refreshes the Knowledge Base content (guidelines, how-tos, templates) while **preserving your adoption files** — your decisions are never overwritten.

## The Development Process

pair defines a 9-step development lifecycle organized in four levels:

| Level | Steps | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Induction** | PRD → Bootstrap → Initiatives | One-time setup: define product, architecture, tech stack |
| **Strategic** | Epics | Break initiatives into feature-level epics |
| **Iteration** | Stories → Refine → Tasks | Break epics into stories, add acceptance criteria, plan tasks |
| **Execution** | Implement → Code Review | TDD cycle, quality gates, structured review |

Each step has a **how-to guide** in `.pair/knowledge/how-to/` that the AI follows, and a matching **skill** (e.g., `/pair-process-implement`) that automates it. Run `/pair-next` at any point to find out which step comes next.

## Choose Your Setup

The steps above work for everyone. For environment-specific configuration:

- **[Solo Setup](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-solo)** — Working alone? Minimal setup, no team coordination needed.
- **[Team Setup](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-team)** — Shared standards, adoption files, and the agent bridge pattern for multi-developer teams.
- **[Organization Rollout](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-org)** — Custom KB packaging, distribution, and governance across multiple teams.
