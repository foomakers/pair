title: Solo Developer Quickstart
description: Install pair-cli and set up your project with AI-assisted development context in minutes.
---

Get up and running with pair on macOS or Linux. By the end of this guide, your project will have a Knowledge Base that gives your AI assistant full context about your development standards.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (or npm) package manager
- Terminal access

## Install pair-cli

### Option 1: Package Manager (Recommended)

Install pair-cli globally:

```bash
npm install -g @pair/pair-cli
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @pair/pair-cli
```

### Option 2: Manual Install (Offline)

For air-gapped environments:

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/foomakers/pair/releases)
2. Extract the `pair-cli-manual-vX.Y.Z.zip` file
3. Run directly from the extracted folder

## Verify Installation

```bash
pair-cli --version
```

Expected output:

```text
pair-cli vX.Y.Z
```

## Explore Available Assets

See what pair can install in your project:

```bash
pair-cli install --list-targets
```

Expected output:

```text
Available asset registries:

  github     .github         GitHub workflows and configuration files
  knowledge  .pair            Knowledge base and documentation
  adoption   .pair/product/adopted  Adoption guides and onboarding materials
```

## Install the Knowledge Base

Navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
pair-cli install
```

This creates the `.pair/` folder with documentation, guidelines, how-to guides, and adoption templates. It also sets up `.github/` workflows and the agent bridge pattern (`AGENTS.md`).

Your project now has:

```text
.pair/
  knowledge/          # Reference material: process guides, standards
    how-to/           # 11 step-by-step guides (PRD → code review)
    guidelines/       # Technical standards (architecture, testing, code design)
    assets/           # Templates (PRD, checklist, commit, PR)
  adoption/           # Your decisions (filled in as you make them)
    product/          # PRD, subdomain definitions
    tech/             # Architecture, tech stack, infrastructure
```

## What Happens Next

When you start a conversation with your AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, Cursor), it reads the `.pair/` folder and understands:

- **How your team works** — process guides define every step from idea to merge
- **What standards to follow** — guidelines cover architecture, testing, code design, security
- **What you've decided** — adoption files record your tech stack, architecture, and way of working

The AI generates consistent, standards-aligned code across every session.

## Next Steps

- Learn [how pair structures AI-assisted development](/docs/concepts/ai-assisted-sdlc)
- Understand the [Knowledge Base structure](/docs/concepts/knowledge-base) in depth
- Explore the [process lifecycle](/docs/concepts/process-lifecycle) — from PRD to code review
