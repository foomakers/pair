description: Quick recipe to override a KB guideline using adoption files — identify, override, verify.

Need to change a single KB default? This is the quick recipe. For the full customization journey — from adopting a KB to publishing your own — see the [Customization](/docs/customization) section.

## Override a Guideline in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Identify What to Change

Browse the knowledge layer to find the guideline:

```bash
# List all guideline categories
ls .pair/knowledge/guidelines/

# Example: see testing guidelines
ls .pair/knowledge/guidelines/quality-assurance/
```

### Step 2: Record Your Decision

Create or update the corresponding adoption file. For example, to change the testing framework, edit `.pair/adoption/tech/tech-stack.md`:

```markdown
## Testing

- jest is adopted as the testing framework (jest v29.x).
```

Adoption files always override knowledge files — no need to touch `.pair/knowledge/`.

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
pair-cli kb validate
pair-cli update-link --dry-run
```

## Quick Reference: Which File to Edit

| You want to change... | Edit this adoption file |
| --- | --- |
| Testing framework, language, library | `.pair/adoption/tech/tech-stack.md` |
| Architecture pattern | `.pair/adoption/tech/architecture.md` |
| Methodology, quality gates | `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md` |
| Add a new guideline | Create a new file in `.pair/adoption/` |
| Record a significant decision | Create an ADR in `.pair/adoption/tech/adr/` |

## What's Safe to Edit

| Directory | On `pair-cli update` | Safe to edit? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.pair/knowledge/` | Overwritten | No — don't edit |
| `.pair/adoption/` | Preserved | Yes — your decisions stay |
