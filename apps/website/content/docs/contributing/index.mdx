## Pull request process

1. **Fork and branch** — Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/#123-description`).
2. **Make changes** — Follow the [development setup](/docs/contributing/development-setup) guide.
3. **Run quality gate** — Execute `pnpm quality-gate` before pushing.
4. **Open a PR** — Reference the related issue. Fill in the PR template.
5. **Review** — A maintainer will review your PR. Address any feedback.
6. **Merge** — Once approved, the PR is squash-merged into `main`.

## Expectations

- **Response time** — We aim to review PRs within a few business days. Larger PRs may take longer.
- **Code quality** — All contributions must pass the quality gate (linting, tests, type checking, formatting).
- **Be respectful** — Treat all contributors with kindness and professionalism.
- **Small PRs** — Prefer focused, small PRs over large ones. They are easier to review and merge.
