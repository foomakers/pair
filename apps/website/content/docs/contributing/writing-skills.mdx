Agent Skills are structured instructions that AI coding assistants discover and execute. They follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, supported by Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and OpenAI Codex.

This guide walks you through creating a new skill for the pair Knowledge Base.

## Skill types

| Type | Count | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Process** | 11 | Lifecycle phases — orchestrate capability skills (e.g., `/implement`, `/review`) |
| **Capability** | 19 | Atomic units — perform a single focused operation (e.g., `/verify-quality`, `/record-decision`) |

Process skills **compose** capability skills. Capability skills are independently invocable.

## Directory structure

Skills live in the Knowledge Base dataset and get distributed to AI tool directories on install:

```text
packages/knowledge-hub/dataset/.pair/knowledge/
├── skills-guide.md          # Full skill catalog

# After pair install, skills are distributed to:
.claude/skills/
├── pair-process-implement/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── pair-capability-verify-quality/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── ...
```

Each skill lives in its own directory named `<type>-<name>` (e.g., `pair-process-implement`, `pair-capability-record-decision`).

## SKILL.md anatomy

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown content:

```markdown
---
name: pair-capability-example
description: "Brief description of what this skill does."
---

# /pair-capability-example — Descriptive Title

One-line summary of the skill's purpose.

## Composed Skills

| Skill | Type | Required |
|-------|------|----------|
| `/pair-capability-other` | Capability | Yes — when invoked |

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `$scope` | Yes | The scope to operate on |

## Algorithm

### Step 1: First Step

1. **Check**: Is the precondition met?
2. **Skip**: If yes, move to Step 2.
3. **Act**: Perform the action.
4. **Verify**: Confirm the result.

### Step 2: Second Step
...

## Output Format

Description of what the skill outputs.

## HALT Conditions

When the skill stops and why.

## Idempotent Re-invocation

How re-running the skill behaves safely.

## Graceful Degradation

What happens when dependencies are missing.
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier, matches directory name |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description (used by AI tools for discovery) |

## Composition model

Process skills orchestrate capability skills through a **compose** relationship:

```text
/pair-process-implement
├── composes /pair-capability-verify-quality (required)
├── composes /pair-capability-record-decision (required)
├── composes /pair-capability-assess-stack (optional)
└── composes /pair-capability-verify-adoption (optional)
```

Key composition rules:

- **Required compositions** — The skill halts if the composed skill is not installed.
- **Optional compositions** — The skill warns and continues if the composed skill is not installed (graceful degradation).
- **Arguments** — Composed skills receive arguments (e.g., `$scope`, `$type`) from the parent skill.

## Algorithm conventions

Skills use a consistent step pattern:

1. **Check** — Evaluate a precondition.
2. **Skip** — If the condition is already met, skip to the next step.
3. **Act** — Perform the action.
4. **Verify** — Confirm the result before proceeding.

This pattern ensures **idempotency** — re-running a skill skips already-completed steps.

### HALT conditions

Skills define explicit HALT conditions — situations where the skill stops and waits for developer input rather than proceeding with incomplete information.

## Writing a new skill

### 1. Choose the skill type

- **Process** if it orchestrates multiple steps across the development lifecycle.
- **Capability** if it performs a single, focused operation.

### 2. Create the directory

```bash
# In the KB dataset
mkdir -p packages/knowledge-hub/dataset/.pair/knowledge/skills/<skill-name>/
```

### 3. Write the SKILL.md

Follow the anatomy above. Key principles:

- **Be explicit** — AI agents follow instructions literally. Ambiguity leads to incorrect behavior.
- **Use the Check/Skip/Act/Verify pattern** — Ensures idempotency.
- **Define HALT conditions** — Better to stop and ask than to proceed incorrectly.
- **Document composition** — List all composed skills with required/optional status.
- **Include graceful degradation** — What happens when optional dependencies are missing.

### 4. Update the skills guide

Add your skill to `packages/knowledge-hub/dataset/.pair/knowledge/skills-guide.md` in the appropriate section (Process or Capability).

### 5. Test the skill

1. Install the KB locally: run `pair install` or copy the SKILL.md to `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`.
2. Invoke the skill via the slash command (e.g., `/pair-capability-example`).
3. Verify the skill follows its algorithm correctly.
4. Test idempotency — re-invoke and confirm it skips completed steps.
5. Test graceful degradation — remove optional composed skills and verify the warning behavior.

## Naming conventions

| Convention | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Process skills | `pair-process-<name>` (e.g., `pair-process-implement`) |
| Capability skills | `pair-capability-<name>` (e.g., `pair-capability-verify-quality`) |
| Assessment skills | `pair-capability-assess-<topic>` (e.g., `pair-capability-assess-stack`) |
