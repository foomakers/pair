description: How pair connects with AI coding assistants through the bridge pattern, supporting multiple agents with a single source of truth.
---

pair works with any AI coding assistant that can read project files. It uses a **bridge pattern** to connect different AI tools to a single source of truth — the [Knowledge Base](/docs/concepts/knowledge-base) in `.pair/`.

## The Bridge Pattern

Each AI tool has its own configuration format for project-level instructions. pair installs bridge files for each supported tool:

```text
AGENTS.md                      # Universal entry point
.github/copilot/               # GitHub Copilot instructions
.cursor/                       # Cursor rules
```

All bridge files point to `.pair/`. There is one source of truth: the Knowledge Base and adoption files. The bridge files simply tell each AI tool where to find it.

### AGENTS.md

The universal bridge file. It sits at the repository root and contains:

- Quick start instructions (which how-to file to read for the current task)
- Essential commands (build, test, lint)
- Key references (adoption files, guidelines, templates)
- Quick rules (testing requirements, adoption checks, commit conventions)

Claude Code and other agents that support `AGENTS.md` read this file automatically when they enter a repository.

### Tool-Specific Bridges

Each AI tool has its own discovery mechanism:

- **GitHub Copilot** reads `.github/copilot/` for custom instructions
- **Cursor** reads `.cursor/rules/` for project-specific rules
- **Claude Code** reads `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/` for skills and instructions

The bridge files are maintained by pair's `agents` asset registry and update when you run `pair-cli update`.

## Multi-Agent Support

A team can have developers using different AI tools. The bridge pattern ensures they all follow the same standards:

1. Developer A uses Claude Code → reads `AGENTS.md` → follows `.pair/` guidelines
2. Developer B uses Cursor → reads `.cursor/rules/` → follows `.pair/` guidelines
3. Developer C uses Copilot → reads `.github/copilot/` → follows `.pair/` guidelines

Same Knowledge Base, same adoption files, same standards. The AI tool is an implementation detail.

## Skills Distribution

[Skills](/docs/concepts/skills) are distributed to multiple AI tool directories simultaneously:

```text
.claude/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md     # Canonical copy
.github/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md     # Symlink
.cursor/skills/pair-process-implement/SKILL.md     # Symlink
```

The canonical copy lives in `.claude/skills/`. Secondary targets (`.github/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`) receive symlinks, ensuring all tools share the exact same skill definitions without duplication.

On Windows, where symlinks require elevated permissions, pair falls back to full copies.

## How Agents Discover Context

When an AI assistant starts a session in a pair-enabled project:

1. **Bridge file** — the AI reads its tool-specific bridge file (or `AGENTS.md`)
2. **Task matching** — the bridge directs it to the relevant how-to guide for the current task
3. **Adoption loading** — the AI reads adoption files to understand project constraints
4. **Guideline loading** — the AI reads relevant guidelines for the task at hand
5. **Execution** — the AI follows the how-to guide, constrained by adoption files and guidelines

This discovery happens automatically at session start. The developer does not need to manually point the AI to documentation.

## Adding New Agent Support

The bridge pattern is extensible. To support a new AI tool:

1. Create a bridge file in the tool's expected location
2. Point it to `.pair/` for the Knowledge Base
3. Add it to the `agents` asset registry for automatic updates

The Knowledge Base and adoption files remain unchanged — only a new bridge file is needed.
