description: How pair generates llms.txt files following the llmstxt.org standard, making documentation and project context natively consumable by AI assistants.
---

pair generates [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) files — a standard format that lets AI assistants quickly understand what a site or project offers, without parsing full HTML pages or navigating file trees.

Instead of forcing an AI to crawl documentation or read every file in `.pair/`, an llms.txt file provides a curated index: what's available, where to find it, and optionally the full content.

## The Standard

The [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) specification defines a Markdown-based format served at `/llms.txt`. The structure is:

```markdown
# Project Name

> Brief description of the project.

## Section Name

- [Page title](https://example.com/page): Optional description
- [Another page](https://example.com/other)

## Optional

- [Less critical page](https://example.com/extra): Can be skipped for shorter context
```

Key rules:
- Starts with an `# H1` heading (project name)
- A blockquote summary follows
- `## H2` sections group links by topic
- Links use `- [title](url)` format
- A `## Optional` section marks content that can be skipped when context is limited

## Three Levels in pair

pair produces llms.txt at three levels, each serving a different use case:

### 1. Site Index — `/llms.txt`

Available at the pair documentation website. Lists all published doc pages with titles and URLs. An AI assistant can fetch this to understand what documentation exists and link to specific pages.

```text
# pair

> AI-assisted software development — structured Knowledge Base, Agent Skills, and adoption files for AI coding assistants.

## Getting Started

- [Quickstart](https://pair.foomakers.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
- [Quickstart for Solo Developers](https://pair.foomakers.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart-solo)

## Concepts

- [AI-Assisted SDLC](https://pair.foomakers.com/docs/concepts/ai-assisted-sdlc)
- [Knowledge Base](https://pair.foomakers.com/docs/concepts/knowledge-base)
...
```

### 2. Site Full — `/llms-full.txt`

Also on the documentation website. Contains the full text content of every published doc page, concatenated with heading separators. Designed to be loaded into an AI's context window so it can answer questions about pair without fetching individual pages.

### 3. Project-Local — `.pair/llms.txt`

Generated locally when you run `pair install` or `pair update`. Summarizes the installed Knowledge Base: adoption files, guidelines, how-to guides, and skills. This gives an AI assistant a map of your project's pair setup without scanning the entire `.pair/` directory.

```text
# pair

> AI-assisted development knowledge base for this project.

## Adoption — Product

- [PRD](.pair/adoption/product/PRD.md)

## Adoption — Tech

- [Architecture](.pair/tech/adopted/architecture.md)
- [Tech Stack](.pair/tech/adopted/tech-stack.md)

## How-To Guides

- [Create PRD](.pair/knowledge/how-to/01-how-to-create-PRD.md)
- [Implement a Task](.pair/knowledge/how-to/10-how-to-implement-a-task.md)

```

## How AI Assistants Use It

An AI assistant consumes llms.txt in two main ways:

**Discovery** — the AI fetches `/llms.txt` from the site to learn what documentation is available, then fetches specific pages as needed. This is efficient: one small request gives a complete map.

**Full context** — the AI loads `/llms-full.txt` or `.pair/llms.txt` into its context window. This works well for questions that span multiple topics or when the AI needs broad understanding of the project.

The project-local `.pair/llms.txt` is referenced from `AGENTS.md`, so AI coding assistants discover it automatically at session start.

## When It Regenerates

| Event | What regenerates |
|-------|-----------------|
| Site build (CI/CD) | `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` — extracted from MDX content at build time |
| `pair install` | `.pair/llms.txt` — generated from installed KB content |
| `pair update` | `.pair/llms.txt` — regenerated to reflect updated KB |

Site routes are statically generated at build time — no runtime processing required, compatible with Vercel's free tier.
