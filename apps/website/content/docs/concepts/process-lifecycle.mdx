title: Process Lifecycle
description: The four-level, nine-step development lifecycle that pair defines — from product requirements to code review.
---

pair defines a structured development lifecycle with **four levels** and **nine steps**. Each level builds on the previous, taking a project from initial idea to production-ready code.

The lifecycle is not rigid — you enter at whatever level matches your project's current state. But every step has a specific how-to guide that the AI follows, ensuring consistency and completeness.

## The Four Levels

### Level 1: Induction (One-Time Setup)

Happens once when starting a new project. Establishes the foundation.

**Step 1 — Create the PRD**

The AI follows a 4-phase process to create your Product Requirements Document:

1. Studies the 13-section PRD template
2. Asks structured questions about users, pain points, features, and KPIs
3. Generates the PRD following the template
4. Submits for iterative review

Output: `.pair/adoption/product/adopted/PRD.md`

**Step 2 — Complete the Bootstrap Checklist**

The AI guides you through technical decisions:

- Project categorization (Pet/PoC, Startup, Enterprise)
- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices)
- Tech stack (language, framework, testing, database)
- Infrastructure (deployment, CI/CD)
- Way of working (methodology, branching, quality gates)

Output: Five decision documents in `.pair/adoption/tech/adopted/`

**Step 3 — Create and Prioritize Initiatives**

The AI extracts objectives from the PRD and proposes prioritized initiatives (P0/P1/P2). Initiatives are created as issues in your PM tool.

### Level 2: Strategic Planning (Per Initiative)

**Step 4 — Break Down into Epics**

Each initiative is decomposed into manageable epics. Epic 0 (project setup) is assessed for new projects. Each epic is created as an issue with a standardized template.

### Level 3: Iteration (Per Epic)

**Step 5 — Break Down into User Stories**

Epics are broken into user stories using **vertical slicing**. Each story is validated against the INVEST framework (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).

**Step 6 — Refine User Stories**

Stories receive acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format, plus technical analysis: API endpoints, data models, UI components, and risks.

**Step 7 — Create Tasks**

The AI generates tasks that reference specific adoption documents. Each task specifies which files from `architecture.md`, `tech-stack.md`, and relevant guidelines constrain the implementation.

### Level 4: Execution (Per Story)

**Step 8 — Implement**

Implementation follows a strict process:

1. **Analysis** — read the story, tasks, and all adoption files
2. **Setup** — create a feature branch
3. **TDD cycle** — for each task: write tests first (RED), implement minimally (GREEN), improve structure (REFACTOR)
4. **Quality gates** — run automated checks after each task
5. **PR creation** — create a pull request following the team's template

The AI never modifies tests and implementation in the same session. Tests first, then code.

**Step 9 — Code Review**

Structured review in multiple phases:

1. **Technical validation** — verify libraries match `tech-stack.md`, architecture matches `architecture.md`
2. **Requirements validation** — every acceptance criterion covered, all tasks completed
3. **Quality check** — quality gates pass, Definition of Done met
4. **Decision** — APPROVED, CHANGES REQUESTED, or TECH DEBT CREATION

If a new library is introduced without an ADR, the review blocks and requests one.

## Flow Summary

```text
Level 1: Induction (once)
  Step 1: PRD → Step 2: Bootstrap → Step 3: Initiatives

Level 2: Strategic (per initiative)
  Step 4: Epics

Level 3: Iteration (per epic)
  Step 5: Stories → Step 6: Refine → Step 7: Tasks

Level 4: Execution (per story)
  Step 8: Implement → Step 9: Review
```

## Entry Points

You don't have to start at Step 1. Common entry points:

- **New project** — start at Step 1 (PRD)
- **Existing project adopting pair** — start at Step 2 (Bootstrap) to record existing decisions
- **Feature work** — start at Step 5 (Stories) if initiatives and epics exist
- **Single task** — start at Step 8 (Implement) if the story is already refined

The `/next` skill automatically determines the right entry point based on your project's current state.
