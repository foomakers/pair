title: Project Management Tools
description: How pair integrates with project management tools to manage stories, tasks, and initiatives automatically.
---

pair manages work items for you. When you run process skills like `/pair-process-implement` or `/pair-process-plan-stories`, pair reads your `way-of-working.md` adoption file to determine which PM tool to use, then creates and updates issues, stories, and tasks automatically.

## How It Works

1. **You choose a PM tool** during project bootstrap (or change it later in `way-of-working.md`)
2. **pair reads the config** every time a process skill runs
3. **pair creates and updates work items** — initiatives, epics, stories, tasks — in the configured tool
4. **Status flows automatically** — completing a task updates the story, completing all stories updates the epic, and so on

You focus on the work. pair keeps the board in sync.

## Supported Options

| Tool | Best For | External Service |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| [Filesystem](/docs/pm-tools/filesystem) | Solo devs, offline work, simple projects | No |
| [GitHub Projects](/docs/pm-tools/github-projects) | Teams already on GitHub, open source projects | Yes (free) |
| [Linear](/docs/pm-tools/linear) | Teams wanting a polished PM experience | Yes (paid) |

### Choosing a Tool

- **Starting solo or want zero dependencies?** Use [Filesystem](/docs/pm-tools/filesystem) — everything lives in your repo as Markdown files.
- **Team on GitHub?** Use [GitHub Projects](/docs/pm-tools/github-projects) — issues, labels, and project boards you already know.
- **Want a dedicated PM tool?** Use [Linear](/docs/pm-tools/linear) — clean UI, fast workflows, great API.

You can switch between tools at any time by updating `way-of-working.md`. Your adoption files and Knowledge Base stay the same.

## The Mapping Model

pair uses a consistent hierarchy regardless of tool:

```text
Initiative (strategic goal)
└── Epic (feature set)
    └── User Story (deliverable increment)
        └── Task (implementation step)
```

Each PM tool maps this hierarchy to its own concepts:

| pair Concept | Filesystem | GitHub Projects | Linear |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Initiative | Markdown file | Issue + label | Project |
| Epic | Markdown file | Issue + label | Issue (parent) |
| User Story | Markdown file | Issue + label | Issue (sub-issue) |
| Task | Checklist in story | Checklist in issue body | Checklist in issue |

## Configuration

All PM tool configuration lives in one place: `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md`. Each tool guide shows the exact configuration lines to add.
