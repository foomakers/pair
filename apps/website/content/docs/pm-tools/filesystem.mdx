title: Filesystem
description: Configure pair to manage work items as Markdown files in your repository — zero external dependencies.
---

## Configuration

Add these lines to `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md`:

```markdown
- Filesystem is adopted for project management, using markdown files and folder organization.
  The backlog is managed in `.pair/adoption/product/backlog/` directory structure.
  See `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/project-management-tool/README.md` for usage.
```

### Prerequisites

- A pair-enabled project (`pair-cli init` completed)
- No external tools, accounts, or API keys needed

This is the **zero-dependency option** — everything lives in your repository as version-controlled Markdown files. Ideal for solo developers, offline work, or projects that don't need a separate PM tool.

## Mapping Model

pair maps its work hierarchy to directories and files:

```text
pair                    Filesystem
────                    ──────────
Initiative          →   Markdown file in 01-initiatives/
Epic                →   Markdown file in 02-epics/<status>/
User Story          →   Markdown file in 03-user-stories/<status>/
Task                →   Checklist item in story file
```

### Directory Structure

```text
.pair/adoption/product/backlog/
├── 01-initiatives/
│   └── 2025/
│       ├── initiative-auth-system.md
│       └── initiative-api-v2.md
├── 02-epics/
│   ├── not-started/
│   ├── in-progress/
│   │   └── epic-user-registration.md
│   ├── under-review/
│   └── completed/
└── 03-user-stories/
    ├── not-started/
    │   └── story-signup-form.md
    ├── in-progress/
    ├── under-review/
    └── completed/
```

### How It Works

- **Initiatives** are Markdown files organized by year
- **Epics and stories** are Markdown files organized by status folder
- **Tasks** are checkbox items inside the story file — not separate files
- **Status tracking** is managed by moving files between status directories
- **Everything is version-controlled** — Git history shows exactly what changed and when

### Status Transitions

| pair Action | Filesystem Effect |
|------------|------------------|
| Start implementing a story | Move file to `in-progress/` |
| Complete a task | Mark checkbox in story file |
| Create PR | File stays in `in-progress/` |
| Merge PR | Move file to `completed/` |
| All stories in epic done | Move epic file to `completed/` |

### Templates

Each work item type uses the standard pair templates:

| Template | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Initiative | `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/templates/initiative-template.md` |
| Epic | `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/templates/epic-template.md` |
| User Story | `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/templates/user-story-template.md` |

## First-Run Example

After configuring `way-of-working.md`, run a process skill:

```bash
/pair-process-plan-stories #epic-user-registration
```

**Expected output:**

```text
STORIES CREATED:
├── story-signup-form.md        → 03-user-stories/not-started/
├── story-login-flow.md         → 03-user-stories/not-started/
├── story-password-reset.md     → 03-user-stories/not-started/
└── Epic: 3 stories created in not-started/
```

pair creates Markdown files using the story template, places them in `not-started/`, and adds task checklists to each file.

### Verifying the Setup

1. Check that `.pair/adoption/product/backlog/` directory structure exists
2. Verify story files appear in `03-user-stories/not-started/`
3. Each file should follow the user story template with filled-in sections
4. `git status` shows the new files ready to commit

### When to Upgrade

Consider switching to [GitHub Projects](/docs/pm-tools/github-projects) or [Linear](/docs/pm-tools/linear) when:

- Multiple team members need to see the board simultaneously
- You want automated status tracking without manual file moves
- You need reporting and velocity metrics

Switching is painless — update `way-of-working.md` and pair starts using the new tool. Your Knowledge Base and adoption files stay the same.
