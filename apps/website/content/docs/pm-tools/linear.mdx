description: Configure pair to manage work items with Linear — setup, mapping model, and first-run walkthrough.
---

## Configuration

Add these lines to `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md`:

```markdown
- Linear is adopted for project management.
  Team: <your-team-key>. Project: <your-project-name>.
  See `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/project-management-tool/README.md` for usage.
```

### Prerequisites

- Linear account with a team and project created
- Linear API key (Settings > API > Personal API Keys)
- Linear MCP Server configured for your AI assistant

### Linear MCP Server

pair's AI assistants use the Linear MCP Server to interact with Linear programmatically. This enables creating issues, updating statuses, and querying project state for `/pair-next` recommendations.

Configure the MCP server with your Linear API key following your AI tool's MCP setup guide.

## Mapping Model

pair maps its work hierarchy to Linear concepts:

```text
pair                    Linear
────                    ──────
Initiative          →   Project (or label-based grouping)
Epic                →   Issue (parent)
User Story          →   Sub-issue
Task                →   Checklist item in story issue body
```

### How It Works

- **Initiatives** map to Linear Projects or are tracked via labels, depending on team preference
- **Epics** are top-level Linear Issues
- **User Stories** are sub-issues under their parent epic
- **Tasks** are checkbox items in the story issue description — not separate issues
- **Status tracking** uses Linear's workflow states (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done)

### Status Transitions

| pair Action | Linear Effect |
|------------|--------------|
| Start implementing a story | Issue status → "In Progress" |
| Complete a task | Checkbox marked in issue description |
| Create PR | PR linked to issue via branch naming |
| Merge PR | Issue status → "Done" |
| All stories in epic done | Parent issue status → "Done" |

### Labels and Properties

pair uses Linear's built-in features:

| Linear Feature | pair Usage |
|---------------|-----------|
| Priority (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) | Maps to P0/P1/P2 |
| Labels | Work item type identification |
| Projects | Initiative grouping |
| Cycles | Sprint tracking (if using Scrum) |

## First-Run Example

After configuring `way-of-working.md`, run a process skill:

```bash
/pair-process-plan-stories #42    # break epic #42 into stories
```

**Expected output:**

```text
STORIES CREATED:
├── LIN-101: As a user, I want to sign up so that I can access the platform
├── LIN-102: As a user, I want to log in so that I can see my dashboard
├── LIN-103: As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover access
└── Epic LIN-42: 3 stories created, all set to "Backlog"
```

pair creates Linear sub-issues under the epic, sets priority, and assigns them to your team.

### Verifying the Setup

1. Open your Linear team's board
2. Verify new issues appear in "Backlog"
3. Each sub-issue should reference its parent epic
4. Priority and labels should match pair's configuration
