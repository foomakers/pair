description: Configure pair to manage work items with GitHub Projects — setup, mapping model, and first-run walkthrough.
---

## Configuration

Add these lines to `.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md`:

```markdown
- GitHub Projects is adopted for project management, using Kanban as the workflow methodology.
  The project is <your-project-name> under the GitHub organization <your-org>.
  See `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/project-management-tool/README.md` for usage.
  Use #github MCP to access GitHub Projects, boards, and issues.
```

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repository access
- GitHub MCP Server configured for your AI assistant (provides API access to GitHub Projects)
- A GitHub Projects board created for your repository

### API Access: MCP + gh CLI Fallback

pair uses the **GitHub MCP Server** as the primary way to interact with GitHub Projects. MCP provides structured tool calls for:

- Creating and updating issues from process skills
- Managing project board status transitions via GraphQL
- Querying issue state for `/pair-next` recommendations

When the MCP server is not available (e.g., in CI environments or tools without MCP support), pair falls back to the **`gh` CLI** for the same operations. The `gh` CLI provides equivalent functionality via `gh issue`, `gh api graphql`, and `gh pr` commands.

```text
Primary:   GitHub MCP Server (structured tool calls)
Fallback:  gh CLI (gh issue create, gh api graphql, gh pr create)
```

Install the GitHub MCP Server following your AI tool's MCP setup guide. If using `gh` as fallback, ensure it is authenticated (`gh auth login`).

## Mapping Model

pair maps its work hierarchy to GitHub concepts:

```text
pair                    GitHub Projects
────                    ───────────────
Initiative          →   Issue (label: "initiative")
Epic                →   Issue (label: "epic")
User Story          →   Issue (label: "user story")
Task                →   Checklist item in story issue body
```

### How It Works

- **Initiatives, epics, and stories** are all GitHub Issues, differentiated by labels
- **Tasks** are checkbox items (`- [ ] **T-1**: description`) in the story issue body — not separate issues
- **Status tracking** uses GitHub Projects board columns (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Hierarchy** is maintained through issue references and sub-issue relationships

### Status Transitions

pair updates status via GitHub Projects GraphQL API:

| pair Action | GitHub Projects Effect |
|------------|----------------------|
| Start implementing a story | Issue moved to "In Progress" column |
| Complete a task | Checkbox marked in issue body |
| Create PR | PR linked to issue via `Closes #N` |
| Merge PR | Issue auto-closed, moved to "Done" |
| All stories in epic done | Epic issue moved to "Done" |

### Labels

pair uses these labels to identify work item types:

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `initiative` | Strategic initiative |
| `epic` | Feature epic |
| `user story` | Deliverable user story |
| `P0` / `P1` / `P2` | Priority levels |

## First-Run Example

After configuring `way-of-working.md`, run a process skill:

```bash
/pair-process-plan-stories #42    # break epic #42 into stories
```

**Expected output:**

```text
STORIES CREATED:
├── #101: As a user, I want to sign up so that I can access the platform
├── #102: As a user, I want to log in so that I can see my dashboard
├── #103: As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover access
└── Epic #42: 3 stories created, all set to "Todo"
```

pair creates GitHub Issues with the `user story` label, adds them to your project board in the "Todo" column, and links them to the parent epic.

### Verifying the Setup

Check that everything worked:

1. Open your GitHub repository's Projects tab
2. Verify the new issues appear on the board in "Todo"
3. Each issue should have the `user story` label and reference the epic
