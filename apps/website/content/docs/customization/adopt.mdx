title: Adopt a Knowledge Base
description: Step-by-step guide to discovering, installing, and verifying a published Knowledge Base for your project.
---

This guide walks you through adopting an existing Knowledge Base — from finding one to verifying it works in your project. By the end, your AI assistant will have structured context for every session.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- pair-cli installed globally ([Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart))
- A project directory (new or existing)

## Browse Available Knowledge Bases

There is no centralized KB registry yet. To find published KBs:

**npm search:**

```bash
npm search pair-kb
```

**GitHub search:**

Search for repositories with the `pair-kb` topic or containing a `.pair/knowledge/` directory structure.

**The pair KB itself** is the canonical example — it ships with the CLI and covers the full software development lifecycle. If you're unsure which KB to start with, use the default.

## Install a KB

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
pair-cli install
```

This downloads the default pair KB and installs it into your project's `.pair/` directory. The CLI creates the full directory structure:

```text
.pair/
├── knowledge/          # Upstream guidelines (updated by pair update)
│   ├── guidelines/     # Development standards
│   └── how-to/         # Step-by-step process guides
├── adoption/           # Your project-specific decisions
│   ├── product/        # PRD, subdomains, bounded contexts
│   └── tech/           # Architecture, tech stack, way-of-working
└── ...
```

To install from a specific source:

```bash
# From a GitHub release
pair-cli install --source github --url https://github.com/org/my-kb/releases/latest

# From a local path (useful for development)
pair-cli install --source local --url /path/to/kb
```

See [CLI Commands](/docs/reference/cli/commands) for the full `install` reference and [Install from URL](/docs/guides/install-from-url) for advanced source options.

## Verify the Installation

After installation, check that the KB is active:

```bash
# Verify KB structure is valid
pair-cli kb validate
```

You should see the knowledge and adoption directories populated. The key indicator is `.pair/knowledge/guidelines/` containing guideline files.

Check that your AI assistant can see the KB by starting a new session — if AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md links to `.pair/`, the assistant will pick up the context automatically.

## What You Get

An installed KB provides three layers of value:

### Guidelines

Development standards covering code design, testing strategy, security, architecture, collaboration, and more. Your AI assistant reads these to produce code that follows your standards — not generic suggestions.

### Adoption Files

Project-specific decisions: which tech stack, architecture pattern, methodology, and quality gates you chose. These files override guideline defaults and ensure every AI session stays aligned with your choices.

You don't write adoption files manually. Run `/pair-next` and the AI walks you through the full process — from PRD to architecture to tech stack — generating each file along the way.

### Skills

Structured instructions that AI assistants discover and execute, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills automate the product lifecycle — from PRD creation to code review — with composable process and capability skills.

See [Skills](/docs/concepts/skills) for how skills work and [Skills Catalog](/docs/reference/skills-catalog) for the full list.

## Keep Your KB Updated

As the upstream KB evolves, pull updates without losing your project-specific decisions:

```bash
pair-cli update
```

The update replaces `.pair/knowledge/` (upstream content) but preserves `.pair/adoption/` (your decisions). See [Customize the Knowledge Base](/docs/guides/customize-kb) for details on how the layered architecture protects your customizations.

## Next Steps

- **First time with pair?** The [tutorials](/docs/tutorials) guide you through adoption with working examples — pick solo developer, team, or enterprise.
- **Ready to customize?** [Customize for Your Team](/docs/customization/team) — adjust guidelines and quality gates for your team context.
- **Need the full reference?** [KB Structure](/docs/reference/kb-structure) — directory layout and file purposes.
- **Want to start the process?** Run `/pair-next` in your AI assistant to begin the guided setup.
