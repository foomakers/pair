title: Adapt pair to Your Context
description: Go from using a published Knowledge Base to publishing your own — adopt, customize, publish.
---

pair's Knowledge Base ships with opinionated defaults. You don't have to accept all of them. The customization path has three stages, each building on the previous one.

## Adopt

Install a published Knowledge Base and start using it as-is. This is the fastest path — you get guidelines, adoption files, and skills without writing anything yourself.

**Audience**: Solo developers starting a new project or adding pair to an existing one.

[Adopt a Knowledge Base](/docs/customization/adopt)

## Customize

Fork and adjust an adopted KB's guidelines, quality gates, and way-of-working for your team. Adoption files override KB defaults, so your customizations survive upstream updates.

**Audience**: Team leads aligning pair with team-specific conventions.

[Customize for Your Team](/docs/customization/team)

## Publish

Create a Knowledge Base from scratch (or fork an existing one), structure it for distribution, and publish it via npm or GitHub so others can adopt it.

**Audience**: Organization architects standardizing development practices across teams.

## Customize Templates

Override the built-in templates that control commit messages, PR descriptions, user stories, and other workflow artifacts. Your customizations are preserved across KB updates.

**Audience**: Teams that need different formats for commits, PRs, stories, or architecture decisions.
