title: Publish a Knowledge Base
description: Create, structure, package, and distribute a Knowledge Base for your organization.
---

You've customized pair for your team. Now you want to codify those practices into a distributable Knowledge Base — so every team in your organization starts from the same foundation. This guide covers the full workflow from creation to distribution.

## Plan Your KB

Before writing content, decide what your KB will cover:

**Scope**: Will it cover the full SDLC (like the pair KB) or focus on a specific concern (e.g., security standards, API design)?

**Audience**: Who will adopt this KB? A single team, a department, or the whole organization?

**Baseline**: Are you starting from scratch, or forking an existing KB? Forking the pair KB gives you a working structure to modify.

## Create the KB Structure

A Knowledge Base follows the `.pair/` directory convention:

```text
.pair/
├── knowledge/
│   ├── guidelines/           # Development standards
│   │   ├── code-design/      # Code conventions
│   │   ├── architecture/     # Architecture patterns
│   │   ├── quality-assurance/ # Testing and quality
│   │   ├── security/         # Security standards
│   │   └── collaboration/    # Process and templates
│   └── how-to/               # Step-by-step process guides
│       ├── index.json        # Task-to-guide mapping
│       └── *.md              # Individual how-to files
├── adoption/
│   ├── product/              # Product context templates
│   │   └── adopted/          # PRD, subdomains, contexts
│   └── tech/                 # Technical decision templates
│       └── adopted/          # Architecture, stack, way-of-working
└── skills/                   # Agent skills (optional)
    └── <category>/<name>/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### Starting from scratch

Create the directory structure manually:

```bash
mkdir -p .pair/knowledge/guidelines .pair/knowledge/how-to
mkdir -p .pair/adoption/product/adopted .pair/adoption/tech/adopted
```

### Forking an existing KB

Install the pair KB and modify it:

```bash
pair-cli install
# Now edit .pair/knowledge/ with your organization's standards
```

See [KB Structure Reference](/docs/reference/kb-structure) for the full directory layout and what each file does.

## Author Guidelines

Guidelines are the core of your KB. Each guideline file should be:

- **Opinionated**: State what is adopted, not what could be adopted
- **Actionable**: AI assistants read these to make decisions — be specific
- **Self-contained**: Each file should work independently

### Writing style

Use the adoption declaration pattern:

```markdown
# Testing Strategy

- vitest is adopted as the testing framework (vitest v3.x).
- Unit test files must be co-located with source files.
- Coverage threshold is 80% for lines and branches.
```

The pattern `[tool] is adopted for [purpose]` tells the AI assistant this is a decision, not a suggestion.

### Adoption file templates

Include empty adoption files that adopters will fill in:

```markdown
<!-- .pair/adoption/tech/adopted/tech-stack.md -->

# Tech Stack

<!-- Record your project's technology choices here.
     Use the format: "[tool] is adopted for [purpose] ([tool] v[version])." -->
```

These templates guide adopters through customization without requiring them to understand the full structure.

## Author Skills (Optional)

If your KB includes AI agent skills, follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard:

```text
.pair/skills/
└── category/
    └── skill-name/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Each `SKILL.md` contains structured instructions the AI discovers and executes. See [Skill Management](/docs/reference/skill-management) for the format and naming conventions.

## Package for Distribution

Package your KB for distribution:

```bash
pair-cli package
```

This creates a distributable archive containing your KB's knowledge, adoption templates, and skills. The package includes metadata (name, version, description) for registry listing.

For organizational metadata:

```bash
pair-cli package --org "your-org-name"
```

See [CLI Commands](/docs/reference/cli/commands) for the full `package` reference.

## Verify Your Package

Before distributing, validate the package:

```bash
# Validate KB structure and internal consistency
pair-cli kb validate

# Inspect package metadata
pair-cli kb info
```

Validation checks:

- Required directories exist
- Guideline files are well-formed
- Internal links resolve
- Adoption templates have correct structure
- Skills follow the Agent Skills standard (if present)

See [CLI Commands](/docs/reference/cli/commands) for the full `kb validate` and `kb info` reference.

## Distribute

### Via npm

Publish your KB as an npm package:

```bash
npm publish
```

Adopters install with:

```bash
pair-cli install --source npm --url @your-org/your-kb
```

### Via GitHub Releases

Create a GitHub release with the packaged archive:

```bash
# Tag and release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# Create release on GitHub with the package artifact
```

Adopters install with:

```bash
pair-cli install --source github --url https://github.com/your-org/your-kb/releases/latest
```

### Via Internal Mirrors

For organizations that restrict external package sources, host the package on an internal registry or file share. Adopters use the `--url` flag to point to the internal location.

See [Install from URL](/docs/guides/install-from-url) for all source options.

## Version and Maintain

### Versioning strategy

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (1.0.x): Typo fixes, clarifications, non-breaking guideline updates
- **Minor** (1.x.0): New guidelines, new skills, new adoption templates
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to directory structure, removed guidelines, renamed files

### Update workflow for consumers

When you publish a new version, adopters pull it with:

```bash
pair-cli update
```

Their adoption files (`.pair/adoption/`) are preserved. Only the knowledge layer (`.pair/knowledge/`) is replaced. This means your updates reach every team without overwriting their project-specific decisions.

### Changelog

Maintain a changelog in your KB repository. Document what changed in each version so adopters can decide when to update and review breaking changes before applying them.
