# Code Design

## 🎯 Scope

This section covers code-level design patterns, principles, and organization strategies:

#### In Scope:

- Framework-specific patterns and implementations
- Design principles and coding standards
- Code organization and structure strategies
- Quality standards and automation tools
- Package management and dependency strategies

#### Out of Scope:

- System architecture patterns (covered in Architecture)
- Infrastructure code organization (covered in Infrastructure)
- Test code organization (covered in Testing)

## 📋 Content Description

This folder provides comprehensive guidance for writing maintainable, scalable, and high-quality code. Each section includes theoretical background, practical implementation patterns, and tool configurations.

# Code Design

## Introduction

Code Design provides pragmatic guidance on how to code: patterns, principles, organisation and quality standards used across projects and teams.

## In Scope

- Framework-specific patterns and implementation guidance (`framework-patterns/`)
- Design principles and trade-offs (`design-principles/`)
- Workspace and file-structure guidance (`code-organization/`)
- Quality standards, linting and automation (`quality-standards/`)
- Package and dependency management (`package-management/`)

## Out of Scope

- System-level architecture, deployment and infra (see `architecture/`, `infrastructure/`)
- Full testing strategy (see `testing/`)

## Files / Directories (this folder)

- `framework-patterns/`
- `design-principles/`
- `code-organization/`
- `quality-standards/`
- `package-management/`

## How to use

Start from `design-principles/` to align fundamental choices, then use `framework-patterns/` for implementation patterns. Use `code-organization/` and `package-management/` to setup the repository layout and `quality-standards/` to enforce quality.
