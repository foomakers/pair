# Performance Metrics

## Purpose

Define comprehensive performance measurement strategies that enable identification of bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and system behavior patterns.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Application performance measurement
- System response time analysis
- Resource utilization tracking
- Throughput and capacity metrics
- User experience performance
- Performance optimization indicators

**Out of Scope:**
- Infrastructure hardware metrics
- Network performance measurement
- Database administration metrics
- Security performance metrics

## Core Performance Metrics

### Response Time Metrics
- Average response time
- Percentile distributions (P50, P90, P95, P99)
- Endpoint-specific latency
- End-to-end request timing

### Throughput Metrics
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Transactions per minute (TPM)
- Data processing rates
- Concurrent user capacity

### Resource Efficiency
- CPU utilization patterns
- Memory usage optimization
- I/O operation efficiency
- Network bandwidth utilization

### User Experience Performance
- Page load times
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- Time to interactive (TTI)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Measurement Strategies

### Collection Approaches
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Synthetic performance testing
- Real user monitoring (RUM)
- Application performance profiling

### Analysis Techniques
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Bottleneck identification
- Performance regression detection
- Capacity planning analysis

## Optimization Framework

### Performance Baselines
- Baseline establishment
- Performance target setting
- SLA/SLO definition
