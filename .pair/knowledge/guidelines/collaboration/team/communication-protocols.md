## Digital Communication Standards

### Written Communication Guidelines

```
Subject Line Best Practices:
- [ACTION REQUIRED] - Response or action needed
- [FYI] - Information only, no response required
- [URGENT] - Immediate attention needed
- [DECISION] - Decision made, implementation follows
- [QUESTION] - Seeking input or clarification

Email Structure:
1. Clear subject line with appropriate tag
2. Brief summary in first paragraph
3. Details and context in body
4. Specific action items and deadlines
5. Next steps and expected outcomes

Response Expectations:
- Acknowledge receipt within 4 hours if action required
- Provide complete response within agreed timeframe
- Use "Reply All" judiciously - only when all recipients need information
- Forward emails only when necessary and with context
```

**Team Chat Best Practices**

```
Channel Organization:
- #general - Team announcements and general discussion
- #project-[name] - Project-specific coordination
- #dev-help - Technical questions and support
- #random - Social and non-work related conversation
- #alerts - Automated system notifications

Message Guidelines:
- Use threads for extended discussions
- Tag specific people (@username) when response needed
- Use @here/@channel sparingly and only for urgent team-wide needs
- Share links and resources liberally
- Keep messages focused and concise

Status Updates:
- Use status indicators to show availability

- Provide context for extended unavailability
- Set expectations for response times
```

```

## Conflict Resolution

### Communication During Disagreements

**Healthy Disagreement Principles**

```
Focus on Issues, Not People:
- Address specific behaviors or decisions
- Avoid personal attacks or character judgments
- Use "I" statements to express your perspective
- Ask clarifying questions to understand other viewpoints

Seek to Understand:
- Listen actively to understand, not just to respond
- Paraphrase others' positions to confirm understanding
- Ask about underlying concerns and motivations
- Acknowledge valid points even when disagreeing

Find Common Ground:
- Identify shared goals and values
- Look for areas of agreement as starting points
- Focus on problem-solving rather than being right
- Consider multiple perspectives and creative solutions
```

**Escalation Process**

```
Level 1 - Direct Communication:
- Address concerns directly with involved parties
- Use structured conversation format
- Focus on specific issues and desired outcomes
- Document agreements and next steps

Level 2 - Facilitated Discussion:
- Involve neutral third party (team lead, scrum master)
- Use structured conflict resolution process
- Focus on team goals and project success
- Create formal agreement with clear expectations

Level 3 - Management Involvement:
- Escalate to management when team-level resolution fails
- Provide documented history of resolution attempts
- Focus on business impact and team effectiveness
- Implement formal improvement plan with tracking

Level 4 - HR/Organizational Support:
- Involve HR for persistent interpersonal conflicts
