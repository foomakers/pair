# Waterfall Methodology

## Overview

Sequential project management approach with distinct phases that must be completed before moving to the next phase, providing structured planning, documentation, and control for projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments.

## Core Principles

### Sequential Phases

- High cost of changes in later phases

Mitigation Strategies:
- Thorough requirements analysis and validation
- Prototyping for complex or unclear requirements
- Regular stakeholder reviews and checkpoints
- Phased delivery approach where possible
```

#### Risk Factors

```text
High-Risk Scenarios:
- Innovative or cutting-edge technology projects
- Unclear or evolving business requirements
- Complex integration with multiple systems
- Tight timelines with limited flexibility

Risk Management:
- Comprehensive risk assessment and planning

- Regular risk monitoring and mitigation
- Stakeholder communication and expectation management
```

## Hybrid Approaches

### Waterfall with Agile Elements

#### Iterative Waterfall

```text
Hybrid Approach:

- Prototyping within design phase
- Incremental development and testing
- Regular stakeholder feedback loops

Benefits:
- Maintains overall structure and control
- Allows for adaptation and learning
- Reduces risk through incremental validation
- Improves stakeholder engagement
```

#### Phased Delivery

```text
Implementation Strategy:
- Break large project into smaller phases
- Each phase follows waterfall approach
- Early phases deliver core functionality
- Later phases add enhancements and features

Advantages:
- Earlier value delivery and feedback
- Reduced overall project risk
- Opportunity for course correction
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction
```

Waterfall methodology provides structured, predictable project management approach suitable for projects with stable requirements, mature technology, and formal governance requirements, while requiring careful consideration of its limitations and appropriate risk mitigation strategies.
