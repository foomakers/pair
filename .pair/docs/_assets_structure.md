# Assets Structure

This document defines the required assets and documentation structure for the AI-Assisted Development Process.

---

## 🧭 **Way of Working**

### Purpose

Establish consistent processes and responsibility frameworks across the development lifecycle.

### Components

- **Process Documentation** → Core methodology and workflow definitions
- **Responsibility Matrix** → Clear AI/Human collaboration patterns
- **Tracking Tools** → Project management systems (markdown files, Jira, GitHub Projects)
- **Communication Protocols** → Standup formats, review processes, escalation paths

---

## 🔧 **Technical Guidelines**

### Purpose

Define comprehensive technical standards that apply to the project development process.

### Components

- **Tech Stack** → Technologies, frameworks, and tools used in the project
- **Coding Standards** → Language-specific and general best practices and conventions
- **Architecture Decisions** → System design, patterns, and structural choices
- **Security Requirements** → Security practices, vulnerability management, and compliance
- **Testing Strategy** → Test pyramid, coverage requirements, automation tools
- **Performance Standards** → Response time thresholds, optimization guidelines, and SLAs
- **Integration Requirements** → External systems, APIs, and data sources
- **Observability Guidelines** → Monitoring strategy, metrics, and alerting rules
