## 📝 NOTES FOR DOCUMENT DEVELOPMENT

- **Version Consistency**: Maintaining version consistency (already partially defined)
- **Architectural Compliance**: Respecting existing architectural patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Code standards to maintain (reference to other document)
- **Testing Requirements**: When and how to implement tests
- **Default Rule**: All workspaces should use consistent versions of tools and dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Same version across all workspaces
- **Important Reasons Only**: Version differences allowed only for critical technical reasons and must be accepted by the Human
- **Human Decision Required**: Never implement version differences without human approval
- **Documentation Mandatory**: All version exceptions must be documented with justification
- **ADR Creation**: Architectural decision (also for a new service) require Architecture Decision Record
