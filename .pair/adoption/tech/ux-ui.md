# UX/UI

- No user interface (UI) is adopted for the initial phase; all interactions are via code and configuration.
- A user interface for RAG management is adopted, built with Next.js and shadcn/ui.
- The application UI follows shadcn/ui patterns for consistency, usability, and modern design.
- User experience is optimized for desktop usage only.
- Design is simple and functional, with no brand guidelines or visual assets required.
- No accessibility standards are adopted for the initial phase.
- No mobile or browser-specific support is required.
- Content is managed by the team and changes infrequently.

---

All user interface implementations must follow these adopted standards. For process and rationale, see [way-of-working.md](../../way-of-working.md).
