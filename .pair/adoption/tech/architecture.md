# Architecture

- The system is designed for a small team and rapid development.
- Architecture supports desktop usage only.
- All components are self-hosted unless external services are required for LLM or vector database functionality.
- Data storage and retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is provided by Supabase.
- Local LLM models are supported via Ollama for RAG use cases.
- Bash scripts are used to coordinate and simplify the execution of AI assistant processes.
- All data is handled in lightweight fashion; no large-scale processing is required.
- No compliance or integration requirements are adopted.
- No formal scalability or performance constraints are adopted.
- No external integrations are required for initial release.

---

All architectural implementations must follow these adopted standards. For process and rationale, see [way-of-working.md](../../way-of-working.md).
