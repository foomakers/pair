## 🗂️ Project Management Framework

### Overview

The project management framework follows a strict hierarchical order: **Initiative → Epic → User Story → Task**. This ensures proper traceability, business alignment, and effective delivery coordination with synchronized status management across all levels.

### Hierarchical Principles

1. **Top-Down Planning:** Start with initiatives and break down systematically
2. **Bottom-Up Tracking:** Track progress from tasks up to initiatives
3. **Horizontal Coordination:** Coordinate work across the same levels
4. **Vertical Traceability:** Maintain clear links between all levels
5. **Status Synchronization:** Ensure status consistency across the hierarchy

### Framework Components

- **Strategic Level:** Initiatives (business objectives, 6-12 months)
- **Tactical Level:** Epics (user value delivery, 2-4 sprints)
- **Operational Level:** User Stories (specific user needs, 1 sprint)
- **Implementation Level:** Tasks (development activities, hours/days)

### State Management and Synchronization

#### Universal States

All hierarchy levels use consistent states for synchronization:

- **Not Started:** Work not yet begun
- **In Progress:** Work actively being executed
- **Under Review:** Work completed but awaiting review/approval
- **Completed:** Work finished and accepted

#### Status Synchronization Rules

1. **Bottom-Up Status Propagation:**

   - Task completion triggers user story status updates
   - User story completion triggers epic status updates
   - Epic completion triggers initiative status updates

2. **Status Consistency Validation:**
   - Parent cannot be "Completed" if any child is not "Completed"
   - Parent moves to "In Progress" when first child starts
   - Parent moves to "Under Review" when all children are completed
   - Parent moves to "Completed" when all children are completed and accepted

### Tool Options

#### Filesystem-Based Management

- Structured folder hierarchy for markdown files
- Complete version control and documentation
- Developer-friendly approach
- Manual status synchronization through file organization

#### GitHub Projects-Based Management

- Integration with development workflow
- Automated tracking and linking
- Issue-based management
- Automated status synchronization capabilities

## 🗂️ Project Management Framework

### Prerequisites for GitHub Projects

Before using GitHub Projects-based management, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

#### GitHub CLI Setup

- **GitHub CLI Installation**: Verify `gh` is installed and accessible from command line
- **Authentication**: Confirm successful login with `gh auth status`
- **Repository Context**: Verify current repository context with `git remote -v`

#### Project Configuration

- **Project Identification**: Determine target GitHub project for work item management
  - If project exists: Use `gh project list` to identify correct project
  - If uncertain: Propose project name based on repository name (e.g., repo `my-app` → project `My App Development`)
- **Project Access**: Verify write access to target project with appropriate permissions
- **Field Configuration**: Ensure project has required custom fields for initiative/epic/story tracking

#### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify GitHub CLI and authentication
gh auth status

# List available projects
gh project list

# Check repository context
git remote -v
```

### Operational Management of Initiatives

#### Filesystem-Based Initiative Management

1. **Creation Process**

   - Create initiatives from PRDs using the comprehensive template
   - List existing initiatives in [`.pair/product/backlog/01-initiatives/`](.pair/product/backlog/01-initiatives/) to avoid numbering conflicts
   - Use naming convention: `01-[initiative-name].md`, `02-[initiative-name].md`, organized in yearly subfolders
   - Complete all template sections before saving
   - **Set Planned Start and End dates only after detailed planning; use TBP (To Be Planned) otherwise**
   - Link to related epics as they are created

2. **Status Management**

   - Organize initiatives in state-based subfolders:
     - `not-started/` for initiatives not yet begun
     - `in-progress/` for initiatives currently active
     - `under-review/` for initiatives awaiting approval/validation
     - `completed/` for finished initiatives
   - Move files between folders to update status (preserve filename for traceability)
   - Update initiative status based on epic completion progress

3. **Validation Requirements**

   - Measurable objectives and success criteria
   - Alignment with PRD goals and business value
   - Clear scope boundaries and risk mitigation
   - Proper naming and documentation conventions

4. **Lifecycle Management**

   - Regular review of initiative progress
   - Update status and metrics based on epic completion
   - Maintain dependency tracking and resource allocation
   - Document lessons learned upon completion

5. **File System Organization:**

```
.pair/product/backlog/01-initiatives/
├── 2025/
│   ├── core-data-pipeline.md
│   ├── unified-portfolio-experience.md
│   └── multi-broker-integration.md
└── [YYYY]/
    └── [future initiatives]
```

#### GitHub Projects-Based Initiative Management

1. **Field Mapping and Template Adaptation**

   - Create GitHub Project issue with initiative template content
   - Map template fields to GitHub fields:
     - **Title**: Initiative name (include initiative number)
     - **Labels**: `initiative`, priority (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`), year, business value
     - **Description**: Full markdown template content
     - **Assignees**: Responsible owner(s)
     - **Custom Fields**: Business value, planned dates, etc.
     - **Status**: Use project board columns (Not Started, In Progress, Under Review, Completed)

2. **Automation and Creation**

   - Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) or GitHub Projects automation
   - Ensure required labels exist before creation
   - Link to related epics, user stories, and tasks for traceability
   - Set up automation for status transitions based on child epic completion

3. **Status Synchronization**

   - Configure automated status updates based on child epic progress
   - Use GitHub Actions or project board automation for status propagation
   - Maintain status consistency across the initiative-epic hierarchy

4. **Example Instruction:**

> “When creating initiatives in GitHub Projects, use the label `initiative` and assign the issue type `Feature`. If the label does not exist, create it first.
> Assign all template fields to the appropriate GitHub issue/project fields. Prefer direct creation via GitHub CLI if possible.”

This makes the process reproducible, minimizes back-and-forth, and ensures the AI can act autonomously with all needed context.
