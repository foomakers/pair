# Way of Working

- Rapid, iterative development cycles with releases as needed.
- Lightweight code review and testing practices focused on speed and learning.
- Minimal documentation: key decisions and usage documented in markdown files.
- Collaboration and process guidelines follow the standards in `/.pair/tech/knowledge-base/12-collaboration-and-process-guidelines.md`.
- Github Projects is adopted for project management, using Kanban as the workflow methodology. See `/.pair/tech/knowledge-base/12-collaboration-and-process-guidelines.md` for usage.
- High risk tolerance: quick rollbacks and fast recovery from errors.
- Team communication is informal and direct, with decisions validated collaboratively.

All development activities must follow these adopted practices. For process and rationale, see [way-of-working.md](../../way-of-working.md).
