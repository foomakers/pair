### 2. Consistency & Standards

- **Design System**: Consistent visual language and component library
- **Interaction Patterns**: Standardized user interactions across the application
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information hierarchy and layout principles
- **Brand Alignment**: Consistent with brand guidelines and identity

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

- **Context-Aware Interfaces**: UI that adapts based on user context and usage patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information and features progressively
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Smart suggestions and pre-filled forms based on user behavior
- **Feedback Loops**: Clear feedback on user actions and results
