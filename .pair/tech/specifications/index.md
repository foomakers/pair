# 📋 Technical Specifications

This directory contains the **validated technical specifications** for the project. These documents serve as the authoritative reference for all technical decisions that have been proposed by AI and validated by the development team throughout the development process outlined in the [way-of-working.md](../../way-of-working.md).

## 📁 Specification Documents

### 🏗️ System Design

- **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** - Validated architectural decisions and system boundaries
- **[tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md)** - Validated technology stack and version decisions

### 🚀 Implementation & Operations

- **[infrastructure.md](infrastructure.md)** - Validated infrastructure and deployment decisions
- **[way-of-working.md](way-of-working.md)** - Validated development practices and team workflows

### 🎨 User Experience

- **[ux-ui.md](ux-ui.md)** - Validated UX/UI patterns and design system decisions

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

These specifications documents are **decision records**, not guidelines. They contain:

- **Validated Choices**: Only decisions that have been proposed by AI and approved by the development team
- **Implementation Authority**: All implementations must follow these specifications
- **Cross-References**: Links to detailed guidelines in the [knowledge-base](../knowledge-base/) for explanations

## 🔄 Update Process

Specifications are updated during specific phases of the development process:

1. **Strategic Preparation**: Architecture and tech-stack decisions
2. **Customer-Facing Iterations**: UX/UI and infrastructure decisions
3. **Continuous Value Delivery**: Way of working and deployment decisions
