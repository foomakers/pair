description: "Stage 2 of the delivery workflow — independent contract validation and deterministic seal in one execution: reproduces every witness and control of a prepared acceptance contract against the unfixed base, re-derives the inventory's classes and interactions from the authoritative producer, checks discriminance (a witness fails for the intended defect, a control may pass, a test-only fix fails on the injected regression), fixture consumption and fixScope, emits ALL concrete gaps it found in one typed rejection with stable row ids — and, when the contract is verified, runs red-snapshot.mjs seal in the same execution and returns the snapshot. Never repairs a contract, never edits production. Dispatched by the batch engine (pair-implement-batch)."

# /pair-workflow-red-verify — Prove the Contract, Then Freeze It

A contract is evidence only once someone who did not write it reproduces it. You are that someone. You never repair the contract: you name every gap you find, once, with the row it concerns — or you seal it. Sealing is Git custody, not reasoning: the script decides.

## Arguments

| Argument           | Required | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$run`, `$story`, `$branch`, `$worktree`, `$base`, `$stacked`, `$entry`, `$policy`, `$inputs`, `$workflowVersion` | Yes | The cycle arguments, as every stage receives them. Handoffs live under `.pair/working/runs/$run/$story/` in the MAIN checkout. |
| `$phase`           | Yes      | `a0` · `a0-rev<m>` · `r<n>-g<k>` · `r<n>-g<k>-rev<m>`.                                                                                     |
| `$head`            | Yes      | 40-hex head the contract was prepared on; `HEAD` of the worktree must be exactly this.                                                    |
| `$contract`        | Yes      | Absolute path of the prepared contract JSON (main checkout's run directory — pass it to the script as-is, never relative to the worktree). |
| `$contractHash`    | Yes      | The hash the preparation stage recorded; `node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/cycle-state.mjs" hash --file $contract` must reproduce it.             |
| `$pr`              | No       | PR number, when one exists.                                                                                                              |
| `$findings`        | No       | JSON array: the obligations the contract must cover (finding ids are the inventory ids you check `covers` against).                       |
| `$regressionGuards`| No       | The authoritative ACTIVE regression risks the resolver derived (US-479 S11/F-RR-03). Compare this set against the contract AND the ledger: a guard missing, extra, mutated or weakened is a rejection BEFORE the seal, and your answer echoes the exact `riskId` set you validated. |
| `$scope`           | No       | JSON `{ groupId, owner, mode, allowedPaths }` of the planned group; the contract's `fixScope` may be narrower, never wider.                |

## Algorithm

### Step 0: Resolve the durable state (mandatory)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(dirname "<absolute path of this SKILL.md>")"
MAIN="$(pwd)"                                   # the main checkout — you have not cd'd yet
RUN_DIR="$MAIN/.pair/working/runs/$run/$story"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/cycle-state.mjs" resolve --dir "$RUN_DIR" --workflowVersion $workflowVersion \
  --policy '$policy' --entry $entry --story $story --inputs $inputs --runsRoot "$MAIN/.pair/working/runs" ${pr:+--pr $pr}
```

- `status: other-run` ⇒ return `{ status: "other-run", runId }`. `incompatible | invalid` ⇒ return `{ status: "redirect", next: { step: "blocked", reason: "failed-resume", detail: <reason> } }`.
- `next.step` is not `validate`, or `next.phase` is not `$phase` ⇒ return `{ status: "redirect", next }` verbatim. Spend no judgment. When `next` names THIS dispatch (`validate`, `$phase`) you ARE the step: continue, never return a redirect to yourself.
- Otherwise continue; `next.attempt` is your attempt number.

### Step 1: Read the contract, verify the tree

1. Parse `$contract`; its `contractHash` must equal `$contractHash` and the script's `hash` output — a mismatch is a finding (`location: $contract`), `verified: false`.
2. `cd $worktree`; `HEAD == $head`; the uncommitted diff contains ONLY the listed artifacts. Every artifact path is repository-relative; `sha256sum` of each equals its stated digest. Anything else ⇒ finding, `verified: false`.
3. Every artifact PASSES the project's format gate (US-479, canary 481-v1). Run the adopted check over the listed artifacts (`pnpm format:check`, or whatever `way-of-working.md` adopts; a project with none skips this). An artifact the formatter would rewrite is a gap like any other — name it with its path, `verified: false` — and NOT a reason to reformat it yourself: you never edit. This is not tidiness. The seal you are about to place makes these bytes untouchable, so an unformatted artifact hands the fixer a round it cannot finish: it cannot reformat (sealed) and cannot push (the pre-push hook runs the gate). Canary 481-v1 died there with the fix already written and green.
4. `fixScope` has one owner, one mode, only the paths the contract needs, and is not wider than `$scope`. A `repair` or `revision` (`-rev<m>`) is not NARROWER than the contract it revises: same `mode`, every predecessor `allowedPaths` entry still present — the sealer re-checks this against the predecessor snapshot's manifest and refuses `fixScope-narrowed`; name the dropped paths as a gap.

### Step 2: Reproduce (every row, every artifact)

1. Run every `redTests[]` `command` yourself while production is unfixed: a `baseline: red` witness must FAIL as `observed` says; a `baseline: pass` control must PASS. For a `mode: test` contract reproduce the injected regression the author describes: the guard fails there AND passes on the current source; a guard that cannot be made to fail proves nothing.
2. Run every `matrix[]` `oracle`; the result must equal `expected`. A `not-applicable` row's `rationale` is re-derived from the producer — if the class can occur, that is a finding on that row.
3. Trace each `kind: fixture` artifact to the exact failing assertion of its `consumedBy` test. A declared fixture column that no expectation reads is not a test.
4. Treat any unsupported claim ("does not compile", a count, a version fact, a prose-regex standing in for behavior) as a finding unless its stated oracle demonstrates it.

### Step 3: Re-derive the inventory

Independently derive, from the authoritative producer named by each `inventory` item (the function that mutates the state, the grammar, the command — never a downstream consumer), every class the producer recognises including the ordinary complement and the smallest interaction cross-product. Every class must be `covers`-ed by a row that discriminates; a missing class is a finding **even when every supplied row passes**. Equivalence between two classes is accepted only with a shared behavioral/grammar rule stated in `rationale`, never because outputs agree today.

### Step 4: Decide — ALL gaps in one answer

Return `verified: false` with **every** concrete gap found in this pass as findings `{ rowId?, mechanismId?, location, severity, description (the failing example / the violated rule), recommendation (the evidence required), obligationIds?, sourceRef?, observedHead?, closureAssertions?, reproducer?, applicability?, counterexampleToCurrentContract?, changedRows? }` — stable `rowId`s so the repair can be traced. Never return the first gap and stop; a second pass on the repaired contract may only add gaps that the repair introduced or that need new evidence. `verified: true` only with zero findings and every command reproduced.

**Naming a mechanism makes it a debt you must close in THIS answer (US-479 T-20, S3):** when a gap concerns a distinct mechanism (e.g. one of several independent producers/rewriters this contract touches), give it `mechanismId` and either:

- `closureAssertions: [{ id, command | testRef, expected }]` — at least one executable reference, never a prose description standing in for behavior (a hand-built stand-in that was never actually run through the real producer proves nothing — Step 3 already requires independent re-derivation from the authoritative producer; a `reproducer.command` you cite must be the command you actually ran, never shell syntax pasted for later execution), or
- `applicability: 'not-applicable'` with a non-empty `applicabilityRationale` — an independently approved reason the class cannot occur, never a shortcut to skip evidence.

When you declare `mechanismsIdentified: [ids]` (the complete set of mechanisms you found broken THIS pass), `publish` refuses the handoff unless every declared id is closed by a finding and no finding names an undeclared one — this is what stops one rejection naming rewriter A while rewriter B, already known broken in the same pass, waits for a second round (canary run 3: two independent Markdown rewriters split across successive rejections). Declaring the set is optional per rejection, but once you do, it is checked exactly.

### Step 5: Seal (only when verified) — the script decides

```bash
cd $worktree && node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/red-snapshot.mjs" seal --pr $SEAL_PR --phase $phase --base $head --contract "$contract" --root "$MAIN"   # SEAL_PR: 0 for the initial chain (a0, a0-rev<m> — it predates the PR and keeps that identity), $pr for a remediation group
```

The script (shipped beside this file, [scripts/red-snapshot.mjs](./scripts/red-snapshot.mjs)) validates the contract path ONCE against the declared main checkout (`--root`: no `..`, under `<root>/.pair/working/runs/`, real path inside it — a symlink pointing elsewhere is an escape; a relative path resolves against the root, never the worktree), then verifies `HEAD == $head`, every artifact's `sha256`, that the tree is dirty only at those artifacts (a `pass` control may be unchanged), writes `.pair/red-snapshots/pr-$pr-$phase.json`, and creates exactly one local `--no-verify` commit carrying `Pair-RED-Snapshot: pr=…; phase=…; base=…; manifest=…`. It is idempotent: re-running after a lost response returns the existing snapshot. A revision (`-rev<m>`) seals as a SUCCESSOR snapshot on `$head`; the earlier seal stays history. Do not retry with a different contract, edit any file, amend, rebase, reset, push or post to make it seal: `{ sealed: false, reason }` is the answer, returned as `sealed: false` with `reason`.

### Step 6: Persist and hand off

Publish the handoff (`skill: "red-verify"`, `inputHead: $head`, `inputsDigest`, `attempt`, `verified`, `findings`, `sealed`, `snapshot?`, `manifest?`, `contractHash`, `reproduced: [{ rowId, command, observed }]`, `elapsedMs`) with `cycle-state.mjs publish … --predecessor $phase-red-spec ${pr:+--pr $pr}`, run `resolve` again and return its `next`.

**US-479 S11 — active regression guards.** When `$regressionGuards` is given, every guard is part of the contract you validate: reproduce each one on the failing head named by its risk, confirm the obligation it cites still passes on `lastCleanReviewedHead`, and reject the contract when a guard is missing, unexecutable or non-discriminating. A guard is not a row you may waive.

**US-479 S12 — reject an incomplete transition matrix.** When the contract changes a persisted
state, a ledger transition, a terminal gate or an evidence identity, a single positive path is NOT
proof of the transition. Check that every applicable negative family of S12 is present with a
deterministic witness and a typed expected refusal, and that the authority you were handed
(`$regressionGuards`, the heads, the batch identities) agrees with the contract. A missing family is
`contract-incomplete:<transition>:<family>`; an inconsistent one is a gap like any other. Never seal
a matrix you could not reproduce.

## Output Format

`{ status: verified | rejected, verified, findings: [{ rowId?, mechanismId?, location, severity, description, recommendation, closureAssertions?, reproducer?, applicability? }], mechanismsIdentified?, sealed, snapshot?, manifest?, contractHash, regressionGuards?, reason?, next }`.

## Notes

- Read-only on the repository except the seal commit the script makes. Never edit, format, push, publish, comment, create a card or merge; never rehash a changed artifact into approval.
- Blind: read nothing under `.pair/working/` except `$RUN_DIR`.
- A typed rejection is the cycle's answer: the coordinator routes it to ONE repair; a second rejection exhausts the unchanged budget. Never soften a gap to let the contract through.
- A repair naming `changedRows` that drops one of this rejection's `rowId`s (when this rejection's findings carried one) is refused by `publish` before it is written — verify every prior closure assertion holds before treating anything as newly closed.
- Your handoff publish is observed by the host runtime (`cycle-runtime.mjs`, US-479 T-25) as a phase-level progress point, through `cycle-state.mjs` — never something you invoke yourself.
